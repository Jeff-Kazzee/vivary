Notable changes to Vivary. The project ships several **independently versioned**
packages, so each entry names the package(s) it affects. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); the initial suite release is
the `v0.1.0` line.

**Current release line:** `create-vivary` / `@vivary/create` **0.4.2** · `vivary-core`
**0.2.7** · `vivary-tropo` **0.5.3** · `vivary-strato` **0.1.2** · `vivary-ozone`
**0.3.1** · `vivary-exo` **0.3.0** · `vivary` **0.1.10** · optional
`vivary-memory-cognee` **0.1.2** · optional `vivary-mcp` **0.1.3**. Versions are
independent. There is no single "Vivary 0.4.2" release.

## [Unreleased: Vivary Front Door] — 2026-09-02

This slice advances the unpublished `vivary` meta-package to **0.2.0** and takes each
routed component to its next patch: `create-vivary` / `@vivary/create` **0.4.3**,
`vivary-tropo` **0.5.4**, `vivary-strato` **0.1.3**, `vivary-ozone` **0.3.2**, and
`vivary-exo` **0.3.1**. Ten user-visible verbs are new, so the meta-package takes a
minor bump. Each component gains one optional keyword and nothing else, so each takes a
patch. Published registry versions remain unchanged.

### Added

- Unreleased Core source now includes Linux project-root custody and a private
  provider for Workbench integration. It recognizes plain folders, Git
  repositories, nested project folders, and linked worktrees while refusing
  lost or unsupported identity. Durable records do not restore authority after
  restart. The source adds no package release or project-write permission.

- The governing engineering policy makes working user capabilities the default
  unit of progress. Agent instructions and the program execution contract now
  use relevant checks and actual application exercises, with optional
  high-assurance controls for named dangerous failures.

- A bounded product source map now routes four cross-cutting responsibilities to
  canonical contracts, implementation, tests, and accepted evidence through Tropo
  typed edges. Runtime packet policy and registry authorization prerequisites remain
  contextual sources until their owning runtime and project-file behavior contracts
  are implemented. A repository checker verifies 16 unique records, the exact edge
  set, and 11 repository-contained source locators, rejects locators that resolve
  back into navigation metadata, rejects source-map symlink and Windows reparse-point
  indirection, and runs with its regression suite in both Ubuntu and governed Windows
  CI jobs. This is maintainer navigation over current sources; it adds no runtime
  behavior or package release.
- The offline headless-loop coordinator selects a runtime, assigned agent, and
  session reference per stage. Explicit completion gates and durable artifact
  handoffs govern planner, developer, and QA transitions. One usage ledger
  survives retries and replay.

  Independent source review and two full 62-test waves passed in offline
  Habitat. Regression stops before QA; incomplete, changed, or late evidence
  records a terminal failure without replaying an agent. The original deadline
  and shared ledger survive restart. Live runtime calls still require an
  enforceable token bound. Native session enforcement, factory integration,
  and package release remain unaccepted.
- Packet 12a defines trusted root/VCS observations and expected refusal
  oracles for access grants, root replacement, and Git/Jujutsu administration.
  The synthetic registry contract and validator bind private Jujutsu repository
  and workspace identities while preserving shared Git contention keys.
  This is a contract and reference-model milestone, with no production
  filesystem adapter, registry database, or live coding-runtime activation.
- Maintainers now have a tracked 36-outcome multi-project workbench program with
  bounded execution packets, a generated lean frontier index and dependency graph,
  linked evidence receipts, and a planning guard for status, dependency, coverage,
  privacy, and evidence drift. Executable reference tools cover deterministic
  registry decisions and synthetic source-preservation and restoration fixtures.
  These are bounded verification tools; they do not claim a package release,
  production enforcement, real-source restoration, or completed product behavior.
- `vivary` now routes ten task verbs to the installed components in the same process:
  `create`, `adopt`, `doctor`, and `capabilities` to `create-vivary`; `check` and
  `find` to `tropo`; `decide` to `strato`; `review` and `impact` to `ozone`; and
  `control` to `exo`. Arguments and output pass through unchanged.
- `vivary --help` groups those verbs as Workspace, Graph and retrieval, Policy,
  Review, and Coordination, and lists the five standalone commands as the advanced
  surface.
- Each route declares the component version floor that shipped its verb. A component
  below its floor is refused with exit code `2` and a message naming the required
  version. The router imports a component only when a verb asks for one.
- A characterization suite freezes the observed command surface of the six entry
  modules before routing, and a router suite compares every verb against its
  standalone invocation on exit code, standard output, and standard error. Two
  `create-vivary` streams name the components installed in the environment, so they
  are judged by fragments and their exact snapshots were dropped, and one no-config
  case was added for `tropo check` in a folder with no `tropo.toml`.
- The `vivary` usage line and its invalid-choice error list all ten verbs beside
  `logs` and `email`, so a misspelled verb prints the whole command set.
- A component that is missing, or too old for the verb, is refused with exit code `2`
  and a `pip install` hint naming the distribution and the floor. Ordering follows the
  release numbers, so a prerelease of the floor version counts as below it.
- A parity checker runs the same comparison against wheels installed into a fresh
  environment, and CI runs it beside the other meta-package proofs.
- `create-vivary` **0.4.3**, `vivary-tropo` **0.5.4**, `vivary-strato` **0.1.3**,
  `vivary-ozone` **0.3.2**, and `vivary-exo` **0.3.1** each add one optional
  keyword-only `prog` argument to `main` and to the parser it builds. `create-vivary`
  and `strato` also name the routed operation's subparser and lift its usage line to
  the top level, `tropo` and `ozone` fix their command positional to the routed
  operation and hide it, and `ozone` and `exo` prefix the receipt-collision message
  with the routed name. Nothing else in those packages changed.
- `vivary <verb> --help` now prints `usage: vivary <verb> ...`, and a usage error from
  a routed verb reads `vivary <verb>: error: ...`. In an installed environment the
  dependency floors guarantee the seam, and the signature check covers a source
  checkout whose imported module is newer than its distribution metadata.
- A routed usage error prints the operation's own usage line, not the component's
  command list. The flat-parser components fix their command positional to the routed
  operation and hide it, so `vivary check --help` and `vivary review --help` carry the
  full option set under the verb without listing the component's other commands.
- The version floor is checked on the imported module. `__version__` is read from the
  module the router just imported, and distribution metadata is the fallback only for
  a component that declares none or an unreadable one, so a source checkout ahead of
  an installed wheel is judged on the code it will run. A module imported from inside
  an installed-packages directory that the installed distribution does not record is
  refused before the call, while a module imported from anywhere else (a source
  checkout, a `PYTHONPATH` tree, the current directory) is a deliberate shadow and
  runs. An import failure in a component or its dependencies is reported without a
  traceback, and a local version segment no longer reads as a prerelease.
- The release artifact gate now covers all nine published Python distributions and
  inventories what they carry: each wheel holds exactly the module its manifest
  declares beside its metadata and license, and each sdist ships no test directory,
  which a new `MANIFEST.in` per package enforces.

### Changed

- The `vivary` meta-package dependency floors rise to `create-vivary>=0.4.3`,
  `vivary-tropo>=0.5.4`, `vivary-strato>=0.1.3`, `vivary-ozone>=0.3.2`, and
  `vivary-exo>=0.3.1`, which are the versions that carry the seam. A component below
  its floor is still refused with exit code `2`.
- `create-vivary` on PyPI and `@vivary/create` on npm move to **0.4.3** together. That
  numeric lockstep is the only one in the suite.

### Fixed

- Agent-Native composition guidance and the execution-copy definition now follow
  the selected runtime and authorized environment. The research review routes
  agents to the generated frontier instead of an already completed packet.
- Multi-project plan checks now require explicit successful verification and record-bound receipts, reject duplicate external gate metadata, and inspect public JSON for private values. Restoration fixture validation rejects malformed base64 and incomplete assertions before materializing files.

### Unchanged

- The standalone `create-vivary`, `tropo`, `strato`, `ozone`, and `exo` commands keep
  every operation and are not deprecated. Standalone help, usage, and error prefixes
  stay byte-identical, which the frozen command-surface table proves.

### Verification

- The multi-project planning guard's 67 adversarial tests passed in the bounded
  Habitat environment with Python 3.11.16. The restoration proof passed 32 tests
  and all 47 filesystem fixture cases in the same bounded environment.
- `python packages/vivary/tests/test_vivary_cli.py` — 9/9 passed.
- `python packages/vivary/tests/test_command_surface_characterization.py` — 3/3 passed
  over 44 cases. The six `create-vivary` operation helps the seam touched were frozen
  by observation and still match the module from before the seam byte for byte, the
  two front-door help snapshots were re-recorded for the new help text, and one
  unknown-verb case was added.
- `python packages/vivary/tests/test_vivary_router.py` — 39/39 passed. Every verb is
  compared against the component itself run under the same program name.
- `python scripts/tests/test_installed_route_parity.py` — 29/29 passed.
- `python packages/tropo/tests/test_tropo.py` — 193/193 passed.
- `python packages/ozone/tests/test_ozone.py` — 110/110 passed.
- `python packages/exo/tests/test_exo.py` — 30/30 passed.
- `python -m pytest packages/core/tests/ -q` — 799 passed, 1 skipped, and 1 known
  failure from the container's `noexec` temporary mount
  (`test_repository_fsmonitor_hook_is_not_invoked_by_default_observation`).
- `python -m pytest packages/strato/tests/ -q` — 48/48 passed.
- `python packages/tropo/tropo.py check --root packages/tropo/examples/vault` — 4
  documents, 0 errors, 0 warnings.
- `python scripts/check_package_docs_parity.py` and
  `python scripts/tests/test_package_docs_parity.py` — contract passed; 10/10 cases
  passed.
- `python scripts/check_ci_workflow.py` and
  `python scripts/tests/test_ci_workflow.py` — contract passed; 20/20 cases passed.
- `python scripts/check_line_endings.py` — 316 tracked text files checked.
- `python scripts/tests/test_release_artifacts.py` — 14/14 passed, and
  `python scripts/check_release_artifacts.py --repository . --artifacts <dir>` over
  freshly built distributions for all nine published Python packages plus `npm pack`
  of the launcher — 19 release artifacts passed license verification.
- Nine wheels built with `python -m pip wheel --no-deps`, installed into a fresh
  virtual environment as `vivary`, `pip check` clean, then
  `python scripts/check_installed_route_parity.py <venv>/bin` — 8 legacy commands, 10
  help parity, 10 usage-error parity, 8 fixture parity, and 1 unrouted operation
  passed — and `... --characterize <venv>/bin` — 44 installed command-surface cases
  passed.
- `node packages/create-vivary/tests/test_npm_launcher.js` — 11/11 passed. The npm
  launcher declares no dependencies, so the advisory gate has no dependency tree to
  audit there.
- By hand against that installed environment at `COLUMNS=80`: `vivary --help` lists
  each standalone command against the verbs it serves, `vivary nope` exits 2 with
  `argument command: invalid choice: 'nope'`, `vivary -- check --root
  packages/tropo/examples/vault` routes and reports 4 documents, `vivary doctor .
  --typo` prints the `doctor` usage line and `vivary doctor: error: unrecognized
  arguments: --typo` with no subcommand list, `vivary check --help` opens with
  `usage: vivary check` and carries no command list, and standalone
  `create-vivary init --help` and `tropo --help` are unchanged.
- The floor regression is reproduced and fixed: with `vivary-tropo` metadata pinned to
  `0.5.3` in an installed environment and the `0.5.4` source tree on `PYTHONPATH`, the
  previous router refused `vivary check` with `needs vivary-tropo 0.5.4 or newer, found
  0.5.3` and the current one exits `0`.
- The graph review gate over a freshly scaffolded workspace:
  `python packages/create-vivary/create_vivary.py init sandboxes/ci-ws --preset coding
  --force --no-wizard`, `... doctor sandboxes/ci-ws`,
  `python packages/tropo/tropo.py check --root sandboxes/ci-ws`, and
  `python packages/ozone/ozone.py review --root sandboxes/ci-ws --strict` — 3 nodes,
  0 warnings, 3 informational notes.
- With Node 22.23.2, `npm audit --audit-level=high`, `npm run sync-docs`,
  `npm run build`, `npm run test:site`, and `npm run test:links` from `site/` — 0
  vulnerabilities, mirrors refreshed, 33 pages built, 14/14 source tests passed, and
  2,749 local references plus 1,550 anchors passed.
- `python packages/create-vivary/tests/test_create_vivary.py` — 194 tests with 2 errors
  and 2 skips in the offline verification container, where the wizard storage tests try
  to install `vivary-tropo[embedded]` at run time. The same two errors are recorded on
  the parent commit, and the failing path is untouched by this slice.
- `python -m pytest packages/core/tests/ -q` — 799 passed, 1 skipped, and 1 failure in
  `test_repository_fsmonitor_hook_is_not_invoked_by_default_observation`. That test
  writes its own fsmonitor hook into the temporary directory and asserts a positive
  control that git executed it. The verification container mounts `/tmp` `noexec`, so
  the control cannot run. No package under `packages/core` changed. CI runs it.

Publishing remains a manual human gate.

## [Published and verified: Vivary Governed Context] — 2026-08-15

The coordinated train published to PyPI and npm from the approved commit
`7fc1920`. A train is a release label, not a suite version. Each package keeps its
own semver, and the only lockstep pair is the scaffolder on PyPI and npm.

### Published

| Surface | Version | Registry |
|---|---:|---|
| `vivary` (meta) | 0.1.10 | PyPI |
| `create-vivary` | 0.4.2 | PyPI |
| `@vivary/create` | 0.4.2 | npm |
| `vivary-core` | 0.2.7 | PyPI (first release) |
| `vivary-tropo` | 0.5.3 | PyPI |
| `vivary-strato` | 0.1.2 | PyPI (first release) |
| `vivary-ozone` | 0.3.1 | PyPI |
| `vivary-exo` | 0.3.0 | PyPI |
| `vivary-memory-cognee` | 0.1.2 | PyPI (optional) |
| `vivary-mcp` | 0.1.3 | PyPI (optional, off by default) |

`vivary-core`, `vivary-strato`, and `vivary-mcp` reach a registry for the first time.
The optional memory and MCP packages ride the train without becoming meta-package
dependencies. Tag `v0.4.2` points at `7fc1920`.

The published 0.4.2 scaffolder writes the five-file thin contract. Users who want the
previous full-layout behavior pin `create-vivary==0.3.1` or `@vivary/create@0.3.1`.

`@vivary/create` published through GitHub Actions Trusted Publishing with the
`npm-trusted-publish.yml` workflow and the `npm-publish` environment. No stored npm
token was used.

### Verification

Cache-resistant installs from the public index, one per artifact, each asserting the
exact installed distribution version:

```bash
uv run --isolated --no-project --no-cache --index-url https://pypi.org/simple \
  --with <dist>==<version> python -c \
  "from importlib.metadata import version; assert version('<dist>') == '<version>'"
```

- `vivary-core==0.2.7`, `vivary-tropo==0.5.3`, `vivary-strato==0.1.2`,
  `vivary-ozone==0.3.1`, `vivary-exo==0.3.0`, `vivary-memory-cognee==0.1.2`,
  `vivary-mcp==0.1.3`, `create-vivary==0.4.2`, and `vivary==0.1.10` each resolved
  from PyPI and reported the expected version.
- `npm view @vivary/create version` returned `0.4.2`.
- `npx --yes @vivary/create@0.4.2 capabilities --preset coding --json` returned
  `ok: true`.

No other release verification was run for this entry. The GitHub release remains a
separate human gate.

## [Unreleased: release artifact license hardening] — 2026-08-13

This slice advances unpublished `create-vivary` / `@vivary/create` to **0.4.2**,
optional `vivary-mcp` to **0.1.3**, and the `vivary` meta-package to **0.1.10**.
Published registry versions remain unchanged.

### Fixed

- The `@vivary/create` npm tarball and the `vivary-mcp` and `vivary` wheel/source
  distributions now carry the repository's exact MIT license text.
- The meta-package floor moves to `create-vivary>=0.4.2`; Python and npm scaffolder
  versions remain in lockstep.

### Added

- Added a release-artifact contract that inspects the exact wheel, source archive,
  and npm tarball paths and fails on missing artifacts, missing license payloads,
  license drift, or npm identity drift.
- Main CI now builds and inspects the seven affected candidate archives. The npm
  trusted-publish workflow performs the same tarball check before either its dry-run
  stop or the separately approved publish step.

### Verification

- `uv build --out-dir sandboxes/release-license-green packages/create-vivary`,
  `uv build --out-dir sandboxes/release-license-green packages/mcp`, and
  `uv build --out-dir sandboxes/release-license-green packages/vivary` — six wheel
  and source archives built.
- `npm pack packages/create-vivary/npm --pack-destination
  sandboxes/release-license-green` — the four-file npm tarball built.
- `python scripts/check_release_artifacts.py --repository . --artifacts
  sandboxes/release-license-green` — seven artifacts passed exact license-byte,
  filename, version, and npm identity inspection.
- `python scripts/tests/test_release_artifacts.py` — 7/7 positive and mutation
  cases passed.
- `python scripts/check_ci_workflow.py` and
  `python scripts/tests/test_ci_workflow.py` — contract passed; 15/15 cases passed.
- `python scripts/check_npm_trusted_publish_workflow.py` — trusted-publish guard
  passed.
- `python packages/create-vivary/tests/test_create_vivary.py` — 194 tests passed,
  including 3 optional/platform skips.
- `python packages/create-vivary/tests/test_assets_parity.py` — 5/5 passed.
- `node packages/create-vivary/tests/test_npm_launcher.js` — 10/10 passed.
- `python -m pytest packages/mcp/tests/ -q` — 23 passed, 1 Windows-only skip.
- `python packages/vivary/tests/test_vivary_cli.py` — 9/9 passed.
- `python scripts/check_package_docs_parity.py` and
  `python scripts/tests/test_package_docs_parity.py` — contract passed; 10/10 cases
  passed.
- `npm audit --audit-level=high` from `site/` — 0 vulnerabilities.
- With checksum-verified Node 22.23.2, `npm run sync-docs`, `npm run build`,
  `npm run test:site`, and `npm run test:links` from `site/` — generated mirrors
  refreshed, 33 pages built, 14/14 source tests passed, and 2,717 local references
  plus 1,519 anchors passed.

Publishing remains a manual human gate.

## [Unreleased: preserve host-owned derived metadata (#24)] — 2026-08-13

This slice advances unpublished `vivary-tropo` to **0.5.3**,
`create-vivary` / `@vivary/create` to **0.4.1**, optional `vivary-mcp` to
**0.1.2**, and the `vivary` meta-package to **0.1.9**. Published registry
versions remain unchanged.

### Fixed

- Permitted untyped documents no longer classify matching derived frontmatter as
  W210 noise. Host-required metadata such as Astro's `title` now survives
  `tropo check`, `tropo fix`, and thin-adoption Doctor validation.
- The legacy analyzer and governed public analyzer share the same boundary:
  typed documents and untyped documents disallowed by policy still emit W210.

### Changed

- `create-vivary` now requires `vivary-tropo>=0.5.3`; optional `vivary-mcp`
  requires the same floor because its bounded adapter calls Tropo's public
  workspace check.
- The `vivary` meta-package floors move to `create-vivary>=0.4.1` and
  `vivary-tropo>=0.5.3`.
- The Tropo specification and command reference now distinguish host-owned
  metadata in permitted untyped documents from Tropo-owned derived noise.

### Verification

- `python packages/tropo/tests/test_tropo.py` — 193/193 passed.
- `python packages/create-vivary/tests/test_create_vivary.py` — 194 tests
  completed, including 3 platform/optional-path skips.
- `python -m pytest packages/mcp/tests/ -q` — 23 passed, 1 Windows-only skip.
- `python -m pytest packages/vivary/tests/ -q` — 9 passed.
- `python packages/create-vivary/tests/orientation_proof.py --receipt
  sandboxes/b12-orientation-proof.json` — current, legacy, brownfield, adopted,
  divergent-checkout, and corrupt fixtures passed.
- `python packages/tropo/tropo.py check --root packages/tropo/examples/vault` —
  4 documents, 0 errors, 0 warnings.
- The approved exact website-adoption plan applied transactionally in a disposable
  fixture. Doctor passed with 34 nodes and no findings, `tropo fix --dry-run`
  proposed no removals, required Astro titles remained present, and the second
  adoption preview was idempotent.
- `npm audit --offline=false --audit-level=high` from `site/` — 0 vulnerabilities.
- `npm run sync-docs`, `npm run build`, `npm run test:site`, and
  `npm run test:links` from `site/` — 33 pages built, 13 tests passed, and 2,705
  local references plus 1,507 anchors checked with zero failures.
- `python scripts/check_ci_workflow.py` and
  `python scripts/tests/test_ci_workflow.py` — contract passed; 14/14 mutation
  tests passed.
- `python scripts/check_package_docs_parity.py` and
  `python scripts/tests/test_package_docs_parity.py` — package/docs contract
  passed; 10/10 mutation tests passed.
- Downstream CI suites passed: Core 801, Strato 48, Ozone 110, Exo 29,
  Memory Cognee 54, thin-init 13, adopt 20, governed record 12, orientation
  regression 9, privacy differential 2, and Strato integrity 7 tests.
- Repository-automation contract and tests passed: 11/11 contract cases and
  18 stats/steward behavior tests.
- Local candidate builds produced wheel and source distributions for the four
  changed Python packages plus the three-file `@vivary/create` 0.4.1 tarball.
  Inventory inspection confirmed license text in the Tropo and create-vivary
  archives and confirmed the previously identified MCP, meta-package, and npm
  license omissions remain separate prepublication blockers.

Issue #24 remains open for the complete website dogfood workflow. Publishing
remains a later, separate human gate.

## [Unreleased: bounded repository stewardship (#159, #212)] — 2026-08-13

No package version changes. This slice makes repository health fail closed on stale
signals, unclassified PRs, and unrecoverable local cleanup.

### Added

- Added testable stats and steward health seams covering authenticated GitHub access,
  bounded registry retry, stale-source propagation, and exact PR lifecycle classes.
- Added machine-neutral checkout, recovery, and worktree lifecycle guidance.

### Changed

- Healthy bot-created stats PRs dispatch exact-head CI with live head/base validation;
  stale snapshots remain inspectable and cannot enable auto-merge.
- Dependabot now has three weekly ecosystem queues, a seven-day version cooldown,
  grouped updates, a six-PR version-update ceiling, and Python's
  `increase-if-necessary` minimum-floor policy.
- Steward now requires fresh warning-free stats and one lifecycle classification per
  open PR instead of treating age alone as evidence for closure.

### Verification

- `python scripts/check_ci_workflow.py`
- `python scripts/tests/test_ci_workflow.py`
- `python scripts/check_repository_automation.py`
- `python scripts/tests/test_repository_automation.py`
- `python -m pytest scripts/tests/test_update_stats.py scripts/tests/test_steward_health.py -q`

Publishing remains a later, separate human gate.

## [Unreleased: lightweight governed-context init and adoption] — 2026-08-10

This slice advances unpublished `create-vivary` / `@vivary/create` to **0.4.0** and
the `vivary` meta-package to **0.1.8**. It also changes the still-unpublished
`vivary-core` **0.2.7**, `vivary-tropo` **0.5.2**, and `vivary-mcp` **0.1.1** source
candidates. Published registry versions remain unchanged. The redesign replaces
default full-workspace generation with a local-first `thin-v0.3` governed-context
contract.

### Added

- Added deterministic brownfield planning with structured creates, bounded managed
  patches, optional projections, kept inputs, conflicts, privacy results, and an exact
  `plan_hash`. Apply requires that reviewed hash and revalidates the plan before writes.
- Added privacy-first transactional apply with plan-bound recovery metadata,
  exact-byte backups, rollback on ordinary failures, and explicit recovery after
  process interruption.
- Added thin Tropo root/config resolution. `.vivary/workspace.toml` owns the base scope;
  root or nested legacy config may tighten it, while competing thin roots fail closed.
- Added optional one-file `agents` and `claude` projections. Explicit
  `cocoindex-code` selection stays inside the same five-file seed by declaring the
  capability and excluding its private index path; it copies no sidecar files.
- Added `create-vivary record`, a read-only plan plus exact-hash apply transaction for
  one typed record earned by real work. It verifies a complete governed or public Task
  Capsule envelope against the current workspace, then binds its id, capsule and
  workspace fingerprints, destination, and before/after bytes. Apply reruns Doctor and
  rolls back on failure. There is no batch, starter-pack, or automatic second-brain
  materialization mode.
- Added a fail-closed public context path for fresh non-Git thin workspaces. It admits
  only the exact generated private/runtime ignore block and reads the validated thin
  type policy. A privacy-admitted root `tropo.toml` may tighten the base; invalid,
  loosening, ignored, or unreadable thin configuration refuses.
- Added six canonical STE100 style guides for workspace creation, agent connection,
  bounded retrieval, approved records, brownfield adoption, and recovery. People and
  agents use the same Markdown sources; the public site and LLM surfaces are generated.

### Changed

- The GitHub Actions `graph review gate` now runs only for pull requests. The site
  build runs only when site code, canonical docs, release surfaces, or its CI
  definition changes; ordinary package-only changes skip the Astro build.
- Default greenfield init now creates exactly three Vivary payload files
  (`.vivary/context.md`, `.vivary/workspace.toml`, and `STATE.md`) plus two bounded host
  integrations (`AGENTS.md` and `.gitignore`). It no longer copies templates, runtime
  skills, placeholders, starter records, or framework prose.
- Default interactive init and plain `--auto` use file storage and install no provider.
  Embedded storage requires `--storage embedded` or the matching wizard choice. Size
  and local privacy hints never grant provider-install authority.
- Brownfield adoption is capped at the same three payload creates and may separately
  create or patch only the generated blocks in `AGENTS.md` and `.gitignore`. Existing
  user content is retained; divergent or unsafe state is an explicit conflict.
- Doctor compatibility schema advances to **2**. Thin workspaces report
  `workspace_contract = "thin-v0.3"`; prior full layouts remain read-compatible as
  `workspace_contract = "legacy-full"` with a separate `legacy_layout` field.
- The legacy full-scaffold asset archive remains available to repository compatibility
  tests but is excluded from wheels and source distributions. Public CLI init/adopt
  use only the thin contract. Obsidian/editor configuration is separate from thin init.
- The `vivary` meta-package now requires `create-vivary>=0.4.0`.
- The optional MCP adapter remains exactly four read-only tools. A capsule returned by
  MCP can bind the separate human-approved one-record CLI transaction; MCP startup and
  tool calls never create records, packs, providers, or a pre-populated second brain.
- Replaced the single exercise page with a routed guide library. Each guide owns
  one task, keeps instructions below the STE100 sentence limits, and routes exhaustive
  flags, schemas, and exit codes to the command reference.
- Retired the pre-release blog queue, its scheduled PR publisher, and the separate
  content backlog. Public release content now begins only after registry and live-site
  verification. The four existing published posts and reusable blog routes remain.
- Strengthened the canonical guide page titles and descriptions, added direct task
  routes to `llms.txt`, and made the site crawler policy explicit for OpenAI search.
- Reframed the prior how-to page as advanced recipes. Its agent setup examples now
  preview file-backed Core before any optional provider installation or authority gate.

### Fixed

- Selected-path Tropo checks now resolve references against every document in the
  bounded snapshot while still reporting findings only for the selected paths, so a
  valid reference outside the selection no longer produces a false `W220`.
- Active-context privacy now stays capability-bound through Tropo validation, Doctor,
  adoption planning and apply, and authenticated recovery. Missing or negated
  `.cocoindex_code/` policy fails closed, while adoption preserves or restores the
  exact generated privacy block for a declared `cocoindex-code` workspace.
- The optional MCP adapter now pins each configured workspace directory with a live
  operating-system identity anchor. A replacement root fails closed even when Linux
  immediately recycles the original directory's inode, while ordinary writes inside
  the original workspace remain available.
- The primary CI job now installs its shared Python test runner before the first
  pytest suite, and a workflow contract guard prevents that ordering from regressing.
- The CI workflow contract now also pins the site dependency audit to
  `npm audit --audit-level=high` in `site/` after `npm ci`. Its regression suite
  rejects a missing, misplaced, or reordered gate, and the release workflow owns the
  live-advisory response for [#232](https://github.com/vivary-dev/vivary/issues/232).
- Doctor repair now recognizes a thin workspace even when its repairable `.gitignore`
  policy is incomplete, and atomic repair preserves the existing file mode.
- The strict orientation proof builds local Core and Tropo wheels before exercising
  the real npm/uvx launcher, so unpublished source candidates do not depend on
  already-existing PyPI releases.
- Init now refuses every nonempty target even with `--force`, so it cannot replace
  user edits in an existing thin workspace. Existing workspaces route through the
  governed adoption plan.
- Adoption approvals now bind the canonical workspace root, stable filesystem
  identity, selected adapters, and exact planned inputs. An approval from an
  identically shaped workspace cannot be replayed against another root.
- Interrupted adoption recovery now authenticates the journal against its approved
  plan and canonical action set. Recovery is read-only by default and requires a
  separate exact recovery-plan hash plus `--yes` before rollback writes.
- Generated-file writes now use verified directory identities and descriptor- or
  handle-relative atomic replacement. Parent swaps fail closed without redirecting
  content outside the intended workspace on Windows or POSIX.
- Recognized legacy-full Doctor repair is now report-only. `--repair --yes` does not
  recreate placeholders, alter privacy policy, or normalize legacy content.
- Updated Linux and Windows installed-wheel CI assertions to the staged package
  versions and dependency floors. Required CI and npm release checks now run thin init,
  governed record, and brownfield adoption suites instead of leaving the new release
  contract outside the gate.
- The optional MCP wheel smoke now installs `mcp==2.0.0` first, then resolves every
  Vivary artifact only from the local candidate wheelhouse. Registry packages cannot
  mask a broken branch dependency.
- Replaced the record command's caller-typed capsule id/hash pair with full-envelope
  canonical integrity, exact scope or workspace fingerprint, and current-workspace
  validation. Tampered and wrong-workspace capsules now fail before a plan exists.
- Corrected the thin tutorial's legacy-only impact exercise and the white paper's stale
  MCP and minimal-workspace descriptions.
- Removed the retired full-scaffold templates and skill packs from the `create-vivary`
  source distribution as well as its wheel; the repository-only archive remains for
  legacy compatibility tests.
- Synchronized canonical docs into the generated site, corrected the release-candidate
  versus published-0.3.1 command boundary, and added one complete capsule-to-approved-
  record exercise.

- Results: Tropo **191/191**, Core **801/801**, optional MCP **30/30**,
  create-vivary **194 run** with 191 passed and 3 intentional skips, thin init
  **13/13** on Windows and WSL/Linux, governed record **12/12**, thin adoption
  **16/16** on Windows and WSL/Linux, orientation proof
  **9/9**, privacy differential **2/2**, Vivary meta CLI **9/9**, Ozone **110/110**,
  Exo **29/29**, Strato **48/48**, optional memory **54/54**, asset parity **5/5**,
  and site contracts **13/13**. The CI workflow contract passed **6/6** tests:
  one real-workflow check and five negative regressions. The online audit control exited **1** with
  four HIGH findings against archived lockfile `68dbee59`, then exited **0** with zero
  vulnerabilities against `b68eef73`. The built-link gate checked **2,681** local
  references and **1,483** anchors across 33 pages with zero failures. Local browser review found
  zero console warnings or errors across the guide index and all six task guides.
- The current working tree built all nine wheels. A fresh isolated environment
  installed `mcp==2.0.0`, then installed `vivary-mcp` and `create-vivary` with
  `--no-index` from that wheelhouse; `pip check`, versions, and the MCP entry point
  passed. npm dry-run produced a three-file, 2.6 kB `@vivary/create` **0.4.0** tarball.

### Status

- Publishing remains a manual human gate.
- No package was published or site deployed. Generated mirrors were synchronized and
  built locally, but brownfield benchmark and adoption dogfood were not performed.
- Exact-commit clean-worktree artifact proof must be repeated after the reviewed
  candidate is committed. Remote CI, PR, merge, and release-tag identity remain pending.

## [Unreleased: Vivary Governed Context release truth and benchmark protocol (#149, #151, #210, #214)] — 2026-08-09

This slice names the coordinated development train **Vivary Governed Context** and
freezes its context-retrieval benchmark protocol. A train coordinates independently
versioned artifacts; it is not a suite semver. Only `create-vivary` and
`@vivary/create` remain version-lockstep. No package version changes in this slice,
and no publication, graduation, benchmark result, or savings claim is made.

### Added

- Added the single migration-classification owner and the compact durable-decision
  index. They route version truth to README, package edges and authority to
  architecture, envelopes to COMMANDS, adapter ceilings to MCP, and release mechanics
  to RELEASE-WORKFLOW.
- Added current Mermaid maps for Core, the four roles, optional memory, MCP, and direct
  package dependencies; added the six public governed-context vocabulary terms and a
  compact schema-envelope index. Behavior claims link to source tests, fixtures, or
  manifests; the retained retrieval-performance comparison is labeled as a hypothesis.
- Added an evidence-led learn-by-doing route and generated-site navigation for the
  tutorial, migration status, and decision index.
- Froze the stdlib Python 3.11 context-retrieval protocol at public corpus
  `cbbd340dbf0ffebfe17ad5257ecd93b83ab570de`: four roadmap questions, baseline
  and governed-retrieval arms, three isolated replicates, exact model/effort/prompt
  settings, fixed work ceilings, deterministic statistics, and strict source-line,
  result-schema, support, runtime, and drift validation. The protocol-only state
  deliberately contains no `results.json` or `docs/BENCHMARK.md`.

### Changed

- README now separates the held Vivary Governed Context source train from the registry table.
- The release workflow now requires a dedicated clean release checkout/worktree and
  defines the named-train lifecycle from planned through verified without aligning
  unrelated package versions.
- MCP now publishes its exact work, input, concurrency, timeout, response, and
  diagnostic ceilings alongside its read-only authority boundary.

### Status

- Source and registry facts in this documentation snapshot: **verified: 2026-08-09**.
- Benchmark validator regressions passed **22 tests** and the protocol-only guard
  verified four questions with no results artifact. Create-version parity passed
  **5 checks**; package-doc parity passed **10 tests** and its canonical check.
- With pinned Node **22.23.2** and npm **10.9.8**, the site audit reported zero
  vulnerabilities, **9 tests** passed, **27 pages** built, and the link check found
  zero failures across **2,075 references** and **1,242 anchors**.
- Publishing remains a manual human gate.

## [Unreleased: brownfield and memory privacy blockers (#266, #235, #236)] — 2026-08-09

This release-train slice advances unpublished `vivary-tropo` to **0.5.2**,
`vivary-memory-cognee` to **0.1.2**, `vivary-mcp` to **0.1.1**,
`create-vivary` / `@vivary/create` to **0.3.4**, and the `vivary` meta-package to
**0.1.7**. `vivary-core` remains **0.2.7**; published registry versions remain
unchanged.

### Fixed

- `base.allow_untyped = true` now permits untyped documents: Tropo omits `W201`,
  validates declared base fields, and ignores fields with no owning type. Setting it
  to `false` still emits `W201` as an error, and typed documents retain `W202`.
  [Regression coverage](https://github.com/vivary-dev/vivary/blob/dev/packages/tropo/tests/test_tropo.py)
- Cognee Doctor validates `memory.cognee.state_path` before testing provider
  availability, so an escaping path is `misconfigured` even when Cognee is absent.
  [Regression coverage](https://github.com/vivary-dev/vivary/blob/dev/packages/memory-cognee/tests/test_memory_cognee.py)
- Memory snapshots now reuse Core's fail-closed Git-ignore privacy policy and pass
  only admitted absolute Markdown paths to Tropo analysis. Built-in and configured
  private paths remain the floor when Git-ignore matching is disabled.
  [Differential privacy coverage](https://github.com/vivary-dev/vivary/blob/dev/packages/memory-cognee/tests/test_memory_cognee.py)

### Security

- The site CI job now runs blocking `npm audit --audit-level=high` immediately after
  `npm ci`. HIGH and CRITICAL advisories block; MODERATE findings remain visible but
  do not block. This threshold catches release-threatening dependency defects while
  reducing unrelated advisory churn. If the live advisory database makes an unrelated
  PR red, maintainers open a dependency-remediation slice and preserve the gate rather
  than skipping, weakening, or marking it non-blocking.
- Red control: the `7a43117^` lockfile pinned PostCSS 8.5.16 and SVGO 4.0.1; the
  blocking audit exited 1 with four HIGH findings, including those two packages.
  Green candidate: after reviewed transitive lock updates to `js-yaml` 4.3.1 and
  `nanoid` 3.3.18, the same audit reported zero vulnerabilities. The site behavior
  suite, production build, and link check then passed. [CI gate](https://github.com/vivary-dev/vivary/blob/dev/.github/workflows/ci.yml);
  [decision record](https://github.com/vivary-dev/vivary/issues/232);
  verified: 2026-08-09.

### Changed

- Direct floors are `vivary-tropo>=0.5.2` for MCP and create-vivary,
  `vivary-core>=0.2.7` plus `vivary-tropo>=0.5.2` for memory-cognee, and
  `create-vivary>=0.3.4` plus `vivary-tropo>=0.5.2` for the meta-package.
- Publishing remains a manual human gate.

## [Unreleased: optional read-only MCP adapter (#206)] — 2026-08-02

Implements [#206](https://github.com/vivary-dev/vivary/issues/206) under the tool
contract resolved by [#225](https://github.com/vivary-dev/vivary/issues/225). The
[release-status section](https://github.com/vivary-dev/vivary/blob/dev/README.md#release-status)
owns current published and development version truth.

This slice adds unpublished `vivary-mcp` **0.1.0** and advances unpublished
`vivary-core` to **0.2.7**, `vivary-tropo` to **0.5.1**, `create-vivary` and
`@vivary/create` to **0.3.3**, and the `vivary` meta-package to **0.1.6**. Published
versions stay unchanged.

### Added

- Added the optional Python 3.11+ `vivary-mcp` package with local standard-input/output
  transport and exact official `mcp==2.0.0` dependency for protocol `2026-07-28`.
- Added exactly `vivary_find`, `vivary_query`, `vivary_check`, and `vivary_capsule`.
  Closed Draft 2020-12 schemas, typed omissions, bounded whole responses, immutable
  operator-owned aliases, SDK-owned discovery, and one active producer bound every
  call.
- Added public Tropo find, query, check, and governed capsule producer contracts over
  Core privacy admission. Public capsule projection excludes raw evidence, commands,
  scope roots, machine paths, credentials, private content, and unsafe claim kinds.
- Added passive `interop:mcp` capability and Doctor reporting. It reads installed
  metadata and entry-point declarations without imports, process launch, or network
  access. Optional absence is healthy; exact SDK mismatch is incompatible; external
  conformance reports `unproven`.
- Added fake-surface unit regressions and official-SDK wire regressions for discovery,
  server/client metadata, schema validation, malformed requests, cancellation,
  timeout, recovery, diagnostics, and exact tool identity.

### Changed

- Core's fixed Git subprocess runner now uses a bounded process scope: a new POSIX
  session/process group or a Windows kill-on-close Job Object assigned before the
  suspended child resumes. Timeout, cancellation, overflow, normal parent exit, and
  read/write failure terminate descendants, reap the direct child, verify scope exit,
  close pipes, and join helpers before returning. An unconfirmed scope stop
  quarantines later process starts for the server lifetime.
- Tropo now binds approved candidates to device, inode, size, nanosecond modification
  and change times around descriptor reads. It rechecks Core's exact allowed paths and
  privacy fingerprint after content processing. Core content search likewise rechecks
  the effective tracked-tree ignore policy after fixed-literal Git search and discards
  results if policy changed.
- On Python 3.11 for Windows, public candidate snapshots now read NTFS change time
  through an attribute-only handle instead of treating creation time as change time.
  The [same-size rewrite regression](https://github.com/vivary-dev/vivary/blob/dev/packages/tropo/tests/test_tropo.py#L2569-L2592)
  restores the documented race refusal on the package's lowest supported Python.
- Public enumeration applies cancellation and hard entry ceilings while consuming
  directory iterators, before sorting. Cancellation propagates through ranking,
  validation, content search, graph projection, capsule compilation, and fixed Git
  work.
- MCP producers have one slot. A timed-out producer that ignores cooperative
  cancellation keeps that slot until its thread exits, so later calls fail closed
  instead of overlapping uncontrolled work.
- The coordinated dependency floors are now `vivary-tropo>=0.5.1`,
  `vivary-core>=0.2.7` from Tropo, and `create-vivary>=0.3.3` from the `vivary`
  meta-package. MCP remains an optional edge: `vivary-mcp → vivary-tropo →
  vivary-core`.
- Canonical architecture, command, data-layer, roadmap, white-paper, package, and MCP
  documentation now distinguish the baseline CLI from the optional read-only adapter.
  No named-client or external-conformance claim is made.

### Security

- Tool callers cannot select a root, executable, shell command, process, transport,
  endpoint, provider, or network destination. The adapter has no write, repair,
  memory-promotion, check-execution, publishing, deployment, or gate-approval path.
- Standard output is protocol-only. Bounded standard-error diagnostics exclude roots,
  aliases, queries, filters, snippets, paths, identifiers, arguments, environment,
  client identity, claims, evidence, credentials, exceptions, and stack traces.
- Candidate bytes remain unopened until Core admits their public names. Changed file,
  workspace, or privacy-policy identity refuses the result. Public capsules bind one
  exact capsule scope root, reject Unicode format-control and normalized credential
  obfuscation, and omit every absolute machine path. Exact JSON-escaped wire responses
  refuse rather than truncate when a response or work ceiling is exceeded.
- The npm trusted-publishing workflow now pins checkout, Python, and Node Actions to
  reviewed immutable commit SHAs before granting publication identity. The
  [workflow guard](https://github.com/vivary-dev/vivary/blob/dev/scripts/check_npm_trusted_publish_workflow.py) rejects those
  Actions when referenced by mutable version tags.

### Verification

- All 15 Core test modules passed on Windows: **800 tests** across three bounded
  `pytest` invocations. A WSL stdlib smoke also stopped an inherited-pipe descendant
  process group in **0.12 seconds**.
- `python packages/tropo/tests/test_tropo.py` — **181/181 passed** on Windows.
- The four bounded `test_create_vivary.py` class runs passed **194 tests** with **3
  skips**. The orientation proof passed **9 tests** and the npm launcher passed **11
  checks**.
- `python -m pytest packages/mcp/tests/ -q` — **28 passed** against official
  `mcp==2.0.0` and `mcp-types==2.0.0`, including a real SDK stdio subprocess and a
  noncooperative timeout quarantine.
- Nine coordinated wheels built without test packages. A fresh offline `vivary`
  install passed `pip check` and proved MCP absent by default. The optional Core,
  Tropo, and MCP wheels also passed `pip check` and launched `vivary-mcp --help`
  against the reviewed SDK closure.
- Package-doc parity passed **10 tests** with three development-source allowlist
  entries. The site passed **8 tests**, built **24 pages**, and checked **1,830 local
  references** and **1,154 anchors** with zero failures.

The pinned external harness documents URL-based HTTP server mode, not stdio server
launch. It has not exercised this adapter, so external conformance remains
`unproven`. Publication, deployment, and default enablement remain manual human
gates.

## [Unreleased: governed installation and capability truth (#207)] (2026-08-02)

Implements [#207](https://github.com/vivary-dev/vivary/issues/207). The
[release-status section](https://github.com/vivary-dev/vivary/blob/dev/README.md#release-status)
owns current published and development version truth.

This slice advances unpublished `create-vivary` and `@vivary/create` source to
**0.3.2** and the unpublished `vivary` meta-package to **0.1.5**. Role and Core
versions stay unchanged. Published versions stay unchanged.

### Added

- Added a fixed public capability inventory for `vivary-core`, Tropo, Strato, Ozone,
  and Exo. Each row names its governed command, authority ceiling, install hint,
  Boolean installed state, deterministic status, reason codes, and missing
  dependencies.
- Added the same capability envelope to successful and repair-error Doctor reports.
  Doctor derives the preset from the workspace declaration. Missing, unsupported, or
  unreadable declarations remain `null`. Doctor does not guess.
- Added package-manifest, installed-metadata, console-target, direct-Core-edge, and
  capability-hint parity tests.

### Changed

- The `vivary` meta-package now installs `vivary-strato>=0.1.2` and requires
  `create-vivary>=0.3.2`. It still receives `vivary-core` transitively through role
  packages and does not declare a duplicate Core edge.
- Capability installation truth is distribution-backed instead of importability-based.
  The probe accepts only active-interpreter canonical package roots. It enforces
  `Requires-Python` for each selected distribution and verifies same-distribution
  selected-extra dependency closure. It binds credited modules to the exact
  distribution `RECORD`. Each console target also requires a regular executable
  launcher in the scripts directory mapped from its selected active installation
  root. The `RECORD` must contain exactly one matching row.
- The npm package remains a launcher for the Python product. Its 0.3.2 source forwards
  `capabilities` and Doctor unchanged instead of adding a JavaScript implementation.
- CI installs only `vivary` from the eight-wheel local wheelhouse into a fresh
  environment before `pip check`. It executes the installed `vivary` launcher outside
  the checkout, verifies the five passive governed capability rows, and runs governed
  CLI smokes for Tropo, Strato, Ozone, and Exo. An explicit Strato install cannot mask
  a missing meta-package edge. CI refuses tracked drift and untracked files under
  generated documentation outputs after the site build.

### Security

- The passive capability reader inspects up to 256 `sys.path` entries and 10,000
  entries across the selected roots. It considers the interpreter's `purelib` and
  `platlib` roots, at most eight system-site candidates, and at most eight user-site
  candidates. It then selects at most eight unique active package roots. Each
  distribution must include exactly one non-empty `Metadata-Version`, `Name`, `Version`,
  and `Requires-Python` field. It may declare at most 64 extras and 256 dependency
  records. Each dependency record may contain no more than 4 KiB. Bounded final-release
  comparison enforces every selected distribution's `Requires-Python`. Unsupported or
  unsatisfied constraints are incompatible. The combined 256 KiB
  metadata-and-entrypoint byte cap bounds unrelated metadata headers. The reader also
  accepts at most 20,000 `RECORD` rows and 2 MiB.
- A same-distribution install extra requires its normalized `Provides-Extra`
  declaration and complete selected dependency closure. Nested extras use the same
  passive metadata proof. The reader follows only selected edges. It accepts at most
  eight extra nodes and 16 dependency edges. Maximum depth is four levels. Each
  dependency may name four child extras and four version clauses. Missing leaves remain
  `not-installed`. Malformed, ambiguous, unsupported, or unsatisfied selected dependency
  declarations are incompatible. Malformed distribution metadata, I/O failures, and
  work ceilings report `probe-failed`.
- Optional-provider floors come from the installed owning package's matching
  `Requires-Dist` extra declaration. Floor extraction uses independently validated
  owner metadata before projecting the separate governed-role dependency contract, so
  a pre-governed but otherwise valid owner can still establish the floor. An installed
  owner's floor is validated even when the provider is absent, and a present provider
  also requires the owner. Missing, duplicate, malformed, or unsatisfied floors are
  incompatible. When both are absent, the capability remains `not-installed`; the
  inventory carries no second floor. Bounded comparison accepts PEP 440 release,
  post-release, and local forms while rejecting pre-release, development, and invalid
  forms.
- Only canonical roots active on the interpreter path are eligible. Linked metadata
  aliases and mismatched distribution-directory versions are incompatible.
- Capability probing does not import role or provider modules, dispatch ambient import
  or distribution hooks, invoke entrypoints, spawn commands, or use the network.
  Probe failures remain explicit and nonfatal to baseline workspace health.

### Verification

- `python packages/create-vivary/tests/test_create_vivary.py`
- `python packages/create-vivary/tests/test_orientation_proof.py`
- `python packages/vivary/tests/test_vivary_cli.py`
- `node packages/create-vivary/tests/test_npm_launcher.js`
- The proof built eight local wheels. A clean environment installed `vivary` alone,
  passed `pip check`, reported all five governed capabilities installed, ran six
  entrypoint help smokes, passed Doctor, and contained no test packages.

Publishing remains a manual human gate.

## [Unreleased: governed recall firewall (#205)] — 2026-08-02

Implements [#205](https://github.com/vivary-dev/vivary/issues/205). The
[release-status section](https://github.com/vivary-dev/vivary/blob/dev/README.md#release-status)
owns current published and development version truth.

This slice advances the unpublished `vivary-core` source to **0.2.6**. Published
versions remain unchanged.

### Added

- Added `vivary_core.recall` as the stable Core import surface for the
  [SPEC-owned candidate-recall firewall](https://github.com/vivary-dev/vivary/blob/dev/docs/bellamente-memory/SPEC-bellamente-memory.md#6-candidaterecallprovider-contract).
- Added pure caller-owned `preserve`, `create`, and `supersede` projections.
  Create and supersede require an exact proposal-bound human approval. Applied
  records are learned assertions with immutable transition provenance.

### Changed

- Bounded the candidate graph, candidate, provider neighbors, and assertion ledger
  before classification or projection. Cycles, unknown neighbor node IDs, malformed
  values, and over-budget inputs degrade or refuse without mutation.
- Validated the complete append-only ledger, including freshness, while restricting
  semantic classification to assertions relevant to the candidate or its named
  correction target. Unrelated stale history no longer blocks new governed transitions.
- Rejected integers outside JavaScript's lossless canonical range before deterministic
  assertion or proposal identity is computed.
- Preserved authored and learned assertion history. Exact transition replay is
  idempotent. Assertion identity or approval-provenance conflicts refuse atomically.
- Kept providers, stores, network calls, workspace policy, and memory activation out of
  Core. Bellamente remains optional and disabled by default.

### Verification

- `python -m pytest packages/core/tests/test_recall.py -q` — **93 passed** on Windows.
- `python -m pytest packages/core/tests/ -q` — **771 passed** on Windows;
  **770 passed, 1 skipped** under WSL Linux.
- Tropo **170/170**, Ozone **110/110**, Exo **29/29**, Strato **48/48**,
  create-vivary **143 run with 1 skipped**, and the meta CLI **9/9** passed on
  Windows. The canonical Tropo example vault reported four documents with no errors
  or warnings.
- Built all eight coordinated local wheels. A fresh environment installed `vivary`
  and `vivary-strato` only from the wheelhouse, passed `pip check`, verified Core
  **0.2.6** and the existing dependency floors, exercised an approved recall
  transition through the installed public seam, and found no packaged tests.
- Package documentation parity passed **10/10** tests and matched **6** published
  manifests plus **2** unpublished allowlist entries.
- `cd site && npm run test:site && npm run build && npm run test:links` — **8/8**
  site tests passed, **23** pages built, and **1,720** local references plus **1,094**
  anchors had zero failures.
- `npm audit --audit-level=high` — no known vulnerabilities.

Publishing remains a manual human gate.

## [Unreleased: governed Exo control (#204)] — 2026-08-01

Implements [#204](https://github.com/vivary-dev/vivary/issues/204). The
[release-status section](https://github.com/vivary-dev/vivary/blob/dev/README.md#release-status) owns current published and
development version truth.

This slice advances the unpublished source versions to `vivary-core` **0.2.5**,
`vivary-exo` **0.3.0**, and the `vivary` meta-package **0.1.4**. Published versions
remain unchanged.

### Added

- Added the Core-owned governed control lifecycle for exact actors, claims, leases,
  dependencies, handoffs, execution evidence, and task integrity over caller-owned
  values.
- Added the unreleased `exo control REQUEST --governed [--json] [--strict]` adapter.
  The [command reference](https://github.com/vivary-dev/vivary/blob/dev/docs/COMMANDS.md#governed-control-development-source) owns
  its request envelope and operation list.

### Changed

- Preserved legacy `exo claim` graph coordination. The governed adapter does not
  persist caller state or change the legacy claim path.
- No package was published, deployed, or enabled by default.

### Verification

- `python -m pytest packages/core/tests/ -q` — **739 passed** on Windows;
  **738 passed, 1 skipped** under WSL Linux.
- `python packages/exo/tests/test_exo.py` — **29/29 passed** on Windows and WSL
  Linux.
- `python -m pip wheel --no-deps --wheel-dir <wheelhouse> ...` built all eight
  coordinated local wheels. A fresh environment resolved `vivary` and
  `vivary-strato` only from that wheelhouse, passed `pip check`, exercised installed
  `exo control ... --governed --json --strict`, and verified Core **0.2.5**, Exo
  **0.3.0**, meta **0.1.4**, dependency floors, the public `record_execution` import,
  and test-free wheel contents.
- `cd site && npm run test:site && npm run build && npm run test:links` — **8/8**
  site tests passed, **23** pages built, and **1,708** local references plus **1,082**
  anchors had zero failures.
- `npm audit --audit-level=high` — no known vulnerabilities.
- `python scripts/tests/test_package_docs_parity.py` — **10/10 passed**;
  `python scripts/check_package_docs_parity.py` matched **6** published manifests and
  **2** unpublished allowlist entries.
- `python scripts/check_line_endings.py` checked **265** tracked text files with
  **8** legacy allowlist entries; `git diff --check` was clean.

Publishing remains a manual human gate.

## [Unreleased: governed Tropo, Strato, and Ozone adapters] — 2026-07-26

Affects the source checkout's unreleased `vivary-core` **0.2.4**, `vivary-tropo`
**0.5.0**, `vivary-strato` **0.1.2**, `vivary-ozone` **0.3.1**, and `vivary`
meta-package **0.1.3**, the first three role-to-core dependency edges, package
documentation, and CI packaging proof. The published releases remain Tropo **0.4.1**,
Ozone **0.2.0**, and `vivary` **0.1.0**; Strato and core remain unpublished during
development. No package was published, deployed, or enabled by default; publication
remains part of the final coordinated release train and requires a separate human gate.

### Added

- `tropo find <task> --governed [--max-claims N]` — an explicit experimental adapter
  from one normalized, allowlisted, read-only Tropo root through `vivary-core`
  observation, content search, evidence-graph projection, and bounded Task Capsule
  compilation. JSON and human output expose evidence-backed claims, conflicts,
  unknowns, omissions, observed required checks, stable selection reasons, and the
  capsule fingerprint. Unicode question terms preserve order and deduplicate; one-letter
  ASCII contraction fragments are discarded before the first **16** meaningful terms
  enter the bounded core content search.
  Content matches bind to those Unicode question terms; matches outside them become an
  explicit `content_matches_outside_task` omission instead of disappearing silently.
- Top-level `vivary_core` exports for the four deep-module entry points used by the
  adapter: `observe_checkouts`, `observe_content`, `project_workspace_graph`, and
  `compile_task_capsule`.
- Direct regressions for the real Git-backed pipeline, equivalent Windows root casing,
  symlink aliases of the worktree root, Unicode workspace paths and question terms,
  observed check derivation, non-negative capsule budgets, blank-task rejection,
  missing-core installation errors, and rejection of incompatible plain-find/query
  flags including `--budget 0`.
- The packaged integration smoke builds every coordinated local wheel, installs the
  `vivary` meta-package with dependency resolution enabled from an isolated wheelhouse,
  installs Strato through the same resolver, exercises the installed governed Tropo
  producer, and separately proves the installed Core → Ozone → Strato bridge.
- The cross-platform orientation matrix now runs the full Tropo suite on
  `windows-latest`, including the governed root-casing contract.
- Session-scoped test harnesses isolate the core and Tropo suites from host user Git
  policy by pinning `HOME`, `USERPROFILE`, and `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` to throwaway Git
  homes. Tropo's direct `__main__` runner uses the same boundary, keeping observation
  fixtures, dirty facts, and fingerprints reproducible under both supported test
  entry points.
- `vivary-strato` **0.1.1** — the first independently versioned Strato runtime package.
  `strato decide --governed` validates a pinned request/policy schema, core-owned actor
  and authority class, workspace fingerprint, absolute path scope bound to its Task
  Capsule, a non-empty project audit label, and caller-supplied timestamps before
  delegating to core's pure budget, capsule/receipt-gate, and next-loop policy. The
  capsule body fingerprint and deterministic identifier are recomputed before
  delegation, so changing either the capsule contents or its identity after compilation
  is refused before policy. Receipt integrity is checked separately against the capsule
  and workspace fingerprints. The compiler and verifier share the JavaScript-lossless
  `max_claims` bound. Complete claims retain their compiler-owned subject, path, fact,
  text, status, evidence, and selection explanation; malformed repository IDs and
  `checkout_of` endpoints are rejected before topology sorting. Malformed task scopes
  or filters, incomplete conflict-side evidence, missing compiler-owned fields, and
  non-canonical values that would be lossy in JavaScript are refused before policy.
  Requests, capsule observations, and receipts have a deterministic 300-second
  freshness window; a verdict without its receipt is rejected. Unknown fields and
  non-string Python mapping keys fail closed, so free-form status text cannot
  impersonate a human gate. Incomplete capsule envelopes and inputs whose JSON or
  evidence graphs are too deeply nested fail closed with typed refusal
  reasons instead of reaching core as successful policy evaluations. `--json` separates
  validated `vivary.strato-decision/v0` documents from
  `vivary.strato-decision-refusal/v0` envelopes with stable reason codes; advisory mode
  exits `0`, while `--strict` exits `1` for a valid `blocked` or `request_gate` result.
- Strato's package and CLI contract have direct tests for core delegation, budget
  exhaustion, intact/insufficient/tampered/stale/malformed/recursive evidence,
  deterministic results, identity boundaries, malformed and deeply nested documents,
  advisory/strict exit semantics,
  and default text output. Isolated package smokes exercise the installed console
  script on Windows and WSL Linux.
- `vivary-ozone` **0.3.0** adds `ozone verify REQUEST --governed`, an explicit
  experimental facade over core's receipt-integrity, gate-sufficiency, and dry-run
  repair contracts. It recomputes Task Capsule identity, binds the workspace and
  caller-supplied clock, applies a deterministic 300-second evidence window, and
  rejects malformed gate constraints, scalar receipt identities, supplied non-mapping
  receipts, contradictory receipt fields, incomplete capsule claims, conflicts, or
  compiler-owned unknown records, duplicate conflict sides, blank task questions,
  malformed task scopes or filters, forged claim IDs, graph-derived claims that do not
  reproduce their source fact semantics, omitted in-scope graph unknowns, claims that
  violate declared filters, claims that do not map to the supplied graph's subject paths
  or graph-profile filters, forged question or content signals, mismatched selection
  tiers, narrated paths outside the declared scope, invalid typed graph relationships,
  and malformed or deeply nested repair inputs before calling core.
  Receipt claim lists must be unique and disjoint. Together,
  they must equal both `claims_in_scope` and the capsule's claim IDs. All claims are
  verified only when the check list is nonempty and every check passed. Otherwise, all
  claims remain unverified. Every receipt check must name a capsule effective required
  check and carry its exact command. Receipt-only self-authored checks cannot create
  gate authority.
  It refuses unknown capsule/receipt fields even when the artifact is re-fingerprinted,
  validates each compiler-owned unknown-record variant, and enforces core's 16-entry
  omission-list/count contract and exact `truncated` marker
  semantics even when no repair graph is requested, applies a 128-byte JSON-encoded
  ceiling on repair identifiers, rejects semantically duplicate selection signals in
  linear time, and rejects duplicate `(subject, fact, claim)` entries before they can
  duplicate deterministic repair IDs. Parser-only help and version actions suppress a
  run receipt that could alias the unread request instead of refusing the requested
  output. Repair graphs are reprojected from checkout paths and facts before repair
  use. Every derived node, edge, conflict, unknown, omission, deterministic ID,
  evidence field, canonical allowlist, and workspace fingerprint must match. Missing
  allowlists, unknown graph fields, invalid semantic fact values, and non-string
  question/content signal terms, fields, and paths fail closed.
  The workspace fingerprint commits each checkout's effective worktree root, semantic
  fact statuses and values, and normalized observation refusals. It excludes evidence
  command text. Known dirty-entry paths must be normalized and checkout-relative;
  unsafe absolute, traversal, drive-relative, or noncanonical paths fail closed.
  Persisted drive and UNC path containment is case-insensitive on every verifier host.
  Ozone refuses retained-fingerprint changes to gate-driving `workspace_markers` and
  `npm_test_script` facts as `invalid_repair_graph`. Invalid fact statuses fail closed
  before projection.
  Capsules retain nonempty explicit `task.required_checks` with unique nonblank names.
  Each check binds to an observed Git checkout execution root related to task scope. A
  package-scoped task may run its check at the nearest enclosing checkout root.
  Validation uses the observed execution root for ancestor scopes, so a checkout path
  cannot authorize an unrelated relocated root or a more distant enclosing checkout.
  Explicit checks remain unchanged in the capsule even without a graph, add to
  evidence-derived checks, cannot rewrite their commands, and resolve
  undetermined-check unknowns only for their checkout. Without a declaration, Ozone
  re-derives required checks and `required_check_undetermined` unknowns from the graph.
  Re-fingerprinted deletion or replacement fails closed.
  Graph-backed verification reconstructs the complete claim list. Complete claims must
  retain the compiler's `known` status. `filtered_out`, `claims_over_budget`, and
  collation omissions must exactly match graph-only reconstruction when no content
  source is bound. Capsules compiled from complete meaningful content observations
  commit their source fingerprint. Governed verification requires a timezone-aware
  observation instant, a nonempty absolute canonical allowlist, contained checkouts,
  reason-consistent refusals, and exact top-level and nested shapes. It recompiles the
  complete capsule from that source and the matching graph. Deleted or rewritten
  content-derived claims, unknowns, omissions, and stripped source bindings fail
  closed. Unknown or reshaped omission variants fail closed. Complete observations
  with no checkouts or refusals preserve absent-content capsule bytes.
  It requires the repair graph to preserve every capsule conflict and in-scope
  graph unknown while allowing a full graph to retain out-of-scope conflicts for repair
  withholding. It recomputes the capsule's normalized repair-topology commitment over
  checkout IDs and paths, repository nodes, and `checkout_of` relationships. A conflict
  that crosses a declared task scope becomes an omission naming only its in-scope subject
  and opaque conflict ID; no out-of-scope side or path enters the capsule.
  Claims on preserved conflict sides must keep the compiler's `conflict_side` tier and
  exact matching conflict-signal set. Claims without a preserved conflict cannot assert
  that tier or signal, so re-labeling cannot change their repair eligibility.
  This authenticates remote-backed and inferred no-remote linked-worktree groups without
  trusting a copied workspace fingerprint label. Ozone requires each divergent conflict
  to cover every checkout related to its repository. Ozone caps scope roots, graph
  nodes, graph edges, and graph unknowns at 1,000 each, graph conflicts at 300, and
  graph claim subjects at 300. It also caps scope-path checks at 100,000 comparisons,
  total checkout-pair scans across all repositories, scope-to-conflict comparisons,
  candidate-by-question-term ranking work, and canonical re-projection work before
  repair construction. Projected `neighbor_of` pairs must also fit the 1,000-edge
  repair-graph ceiling. Remaining re-projection work counts graph JSON and repeated
  checkout-path expansion, with a cap of 10,000,000 canonical-JSON work units.
  Route-proposal evidence stays within core's checkout cap. Derived repair estimates
  stay within JavaScript's lossless integer range.
  It returns typed verification or refusal envelopes. Core's fingerprinted receipt/gate
  verdicts and repair proposal pass through unchanged; Strato consumes the raw
  `gate_verdict` without a second verification implementation. The CLI rejects
  `--governed` on `review`, `impact`, and `packs` rather than silently running an
  ordinary command. It refuses run-receipt output whenever `REQUEST` is `-`, because a
  pipe or redirection does not expose enough source identity to prove the target is
  distinct. Plain-text refusal output JSON-escapes reason fragments before writing
  them, including unpaired Unicode surrogates. Advisory mode exits `0`, `--strict`
  exits `1` for a valid insufficient result, and malformed request documents or
  refused request envelopes exit `2`.
- Ozone regressions cover sufficient, wrong-claim-ID, contradictory-claim-list,
  duplicate-claim-ID, duplicate-claim-semantics, duplicate-check, receipt-extension,
  core-unknown, command-presence, flag-scope, non-mapping-receipt, incomplete-claim,
  topology-identifier, missing, tampered, stale, workspace-mismatched, budget-limited,
  request/receipt-alias, piped-stdin-receipt, unknown-artifact, bounded-repair,
  pair-scan-bound, route-evidence-bound, repair-product-bound, identifier-bound,
  omission-bound, estimate-bound, gate-shape, graph-relationship, full canonical graph,
  every derived node kind, forged edge/conflict identity, exact unknown/omission
  projection, required allowlist, non-string signals, scoped-full-graph,
  forged-in-scope-conflict, filter-binding, conflict-binding, selection-binding,
  topology-commitment, output-escaping, malformed, recursive, repair, CLI, and real
  Ozone-to-Strato cases.
  The installed-package CI smoke
  resolves the complete local meta-package dependency graph, proves Ozone's core floor,
  runs the packaged Ozone verdict path, and hands its unchanged verdict to Strato.

### Changed

- `vivary-core` advances from 0.2.0 to 0.2.4. Version 0.2.1 introduced the governed
  adapter API; 0.2.2 hardened the compiler/verifier integrity boundary; 0.2.3 added the
  repair-topology commitment API and complete compiler-owned capsule validation; 0.2.4
  centralizes exact Task Capsule and Execution Receipt field ownership, exports the
  shared UTF-16 ordering key, and hardens capsule/graph reconstruction.
  `vivary-tropo` advances from 0.4.1 to 0.5.0 because the governed flags are a
  user-visible minor feature and keeps `vivary-core>=0.2.1`, the first source version
  exposing the adapter API. This is the first real package-to-core dependency promised
  by [#207](https://github.com/vivary-dev/vivary/issues/207).
- The `vivary` meta-package advances from 0.1.0 to 0.1.3: 0.1.1 raised its floor to
  `vivary-tropo>=0.5.0`, 0.1.2 raised its floor to `vivary-ozone>=0.3.0`, and 0.1.3
  raises that floor to `vivary-ozone>=0.3.1`. A fresh suite install cannot resolve the
  pre-hardening Ozone CLI. All development versions remain unpublished until the
  coordinated release.
- `vivary-strato` advances from 0.1.0 to 0.1.2 and declares
  `vivary-core>=0.2.4`. Version 0.1.1 introduced the governed runtime and capsule
  integrity boundary; 0.1.2 consumes Core's exact artifact schemas. The `vivary` meta
  package does not add Strato yet; completing the one-install role surface remains
  owned by #207. Both Strato and core stay explicitly allowlisted as unpublished until
  the final coordinated release gate.
- `vivary-ozone` advances from 0.2.0 to 0.3.1. Version 0.3.0 introduced the user-visible
  `verify --governed` command; 0.3.1 declares `vivary-core>=0.2.4` and hardens that
  request boundary. Plain `review`, `impact`, and `packs` behavior remains unchanged.
  Ozone 0.3.1 stays unpublished until the final coordinated release gate.
- Core rejects blank, relative, or traversal-bearing declared scope roots and check
  working directories; blank filter values; duplicate checkout identities; excessive
  checkout/content-containment, combined candidate-aggregation, or
  candidate-by-question-term-and-filter ranking work; unsafe dirty-entry or
  content-match paths; malformed semantic fact
  values; non-`known` compiled claim statuses; missing canonical allowlists; altered
  compiler-owned omissions; and top-level capsule or receipt field smuggling. Accepted
  checkout, worktree-root, Git-common-dir, content, and scope paths are traversal-free
  canonical absolute paths. Windows drive and UNC containment and identity joins are
  host-independent. Graphless check working directories must lie within task scope;
  graph-backed package scopes may use their nearest observed enclosing checkout root.
  Capsules compiled from complete meaningful content observations commit that exact
  source fingerprint. Core rejects malformed, field-smuggled, duplicate,
  traversal-bearing, uncontained, impossible-revision, or work-unbounded content and
  content-derived records whose binding was stripped, then recompiles the complete
  capsule during graph-context matching. Graph-only selection, collation,
  scoped-conflict, and explicit full-workspace refusal omissions match compilation
  exactly. `compile_task_capsule` normalizes malformed filter-contract
  errors to `ValueError`; direct `validate_filters` callers retain its lower-level
  `TypeError`.
- Core receipt verification rejects every check whose name or command is absent from
  the capsule's effective authority. Direct Core and Strato gate callers cannot accept
  self-authored receipt checks.
- Ozone preflights whole-request JSON, content-containment, and repair work before
  recursive validation. It maps Core's receipt-authority, source-shape, and typed work
  decisions to typed facade refusals. Graphless effective checks must equal the task
  declaration exactly. Capsules carrying derived checks return
  `graph_required_for_effective_checks` until the matching graph is supplied. Compiler
  selection and collation omissions also require the graph because their provenance is
  ambiguous without reconstruction. Content-bound capsules require both the matching
  graph and exact source observation. Unbounded content validation, combined
  graph-plus-content candidate aggregation, or ranking reconstruction returns
  `repair_work_unbounded`. Unknown artifact fields retain their specific sorted refusal
  reasons without an added generic shape reason.
- Core's observe, evidence, and topology tests use process-unique OS temporary fixture
  roots, preventing concurrent Windows/WSL sessions from deleting each other's data.
  CI adds an explicit Windows/Python 3.11 governed-verification job across Core, Ozone,
  and Strato.
- Plain `tropo find` keeps its existing typed-context packet and default token budget.
  Governed-only flags, malformed core inputs, and broken core installs fail with the
  documented usage exit code `2`; the command reference owns the exact flag contract.
- Core's shared bounded subprocess runner drains stdout and stderr concurrently, so a
  Git child that fills stderr first cannot deadlock observation. Cleanup kills stalled
  children, closes completed pipes, and returns a structured timeout rather than
  blocking on an inherited stderr handle.
- Core gate-sufficiency evaluation indexes validated receipt claim IDs once before
  matching capsule coverage, keeping the evidence check linear in request size.
- Core context-repair generation indexes conflicts by repository once before expansion,
  avoiding a repository-by-conflict cross-product.
- Ozone refuses a run-receipt target that identifies a file-backed verification
  request, including through a hard-link alias. It refuses all run-receipt output when
  `REQUEST` is `-`, because stdin cannot prove that the target is distinct.
- Derived required checks now carry checkout-scoped names, the normalized checkout
  `cwd`, and the observation that actually proves each command. This prevents one
  checkout's receipt from clearing another checkout's check. An observed npm test
  script also no longer suppresses an undetermined Python test-system warning in a
  polyglot checkout.
- Governed content now resolves and records each checkout's HEAD before searching that
  named commit tree with replacement objects disabled, so mutable worktree bytes or
  replace refs cannot masquerade as the named revision. Workspace graphs and content
  sources also share a fingerprint of effective ignore decisions over that tracked
  tree; changing `.gitignore`, repository excludes, or effective excludes policy
  invalidates prior excerpts even when HEAD and dirty path/state facts are unchanged.
  Zero-match searches retain both bindings; nonempty-term observations without them are
  invalid source artifacts. Duplicate checkout and match identities fail closed, using
  the same host-independent drive/UNC identity as graph joins. Equivalent root casing
  preserves exact-root trust; noncanonical accepted aliases are refused before Git
  access. Git-legal but unsafe relative match and dirty paths become nondisclosing
  omissions or unknowns. NUL-framed Git output and one bounded NUL-framed
  `check-ignore --stdin` privacy query avoid naming excluded tracked files in
  evidence. Unexpected ignore output and incomplete injected-runner failures fail
  closed.
  Unicode workspace paths use a deterministic graph-ordering fallback; unrankable
  non-content capsule facts become explicit omissions instead of aborting Unicode
  queries.
- Governed mode refuses a Tropo root nested inside a larger Git worktree rather than
  labeling repository-wide checkout facts as scoped to the nested directory.
- Standalone Tropo graphs now derive only `tropo check`; `create-vivary doctor` requires
  the observed `tropo.toml` + `AGENTS.md` + `STRATO.md` scaffold identity. Governed
  query fallback no longer restores filtered stopwords or one-letter ASCII fragments,
  and checkout observation sorts non-Latin remote names with the deterministic Unicode
  fallback instead of aborting.
- Governed content is bracketed by checkout observations and retried once when the
  worktree changes. Dirty or privacy-filtered checkouts also require two identical
  content scans inside a stable fact bracket; persistent mutation produces an explicit
  content-unavailable unknown instead of a mixed-state capsule. A checkout whose dirty
  state cannot be established reports `dirty_state_unknown`, not a false mutation race.
  Every default Git command used for observation or content retrieval disables
  repository-configured filesystem monitors. Workspace markers and package scripts
  pass through the same fail-closed ignore-policy filter as content and dirty paths;
  reparse-point and multiply linked markers are rejected, and package manifests are
  read through a bounded descriptor whose file identity is verified before and after
  opening. An ignored or externally linked manifest cannot leak facts or derive an
  executable check.
  The hardened boundary preserves Git-parsed `core.autocrlf`/`core.eol` and an
  explicit readable global or system `core.excludesFile` without honoring ambient
  `GIT_*` injection or overriding repository-scoped ignore policy. Host ignore
  policy can therefore legitimately change dirty facts, workspace fingerprints, and
  capsule IDs between machines, matching the host's own `git status`.
- Governed graph verification recomputes the workspace fingerprint from emitted
  checkout nodes, including their effective worktree roots, and requires the graph
  timestamp to match the capsule observation.
  It reconstructs compiler selection from graph candidates and retained content-match
  candidates under the capsule's task, filters, scope, and budget. At a fixed budget
  and retained content set, added, removed, moved, or rewritten graph claims fail closed
  without rejecting content-ranked capsules.
  Global graph and repair-work caps run before claim reconstruction.
- Derived checks execute from the observed Git worktree root even when the requested
  checkout path is nested. Excessively nested `package.json` input now degrades to no
  npm check instead of escaping the structured observation contract.
- Semantic-memory configuration now returns structured misconfiguration results for
  unreadable or invalid-UTF-8 TOML. Optional-provider failures identify the provider
  boundary and name a workspace-disabled `memory.cognee.allow_network` gate without
  returning exception text that can disclose filesystem paths.
- Generated `llms.txt` package surfaces read published versions from the root release
  table rather than unreleased source manifests. On-demand examples use
  `uvx --from <distribution> <command>`, matching each package's console entry point.
  The Strato integrity gate now locks core's full-scaffold marker set to
  create-vivary's repair contract.
- The Tropo package quickstart copies the example vault into a guarded temporary Git
  fixture, commits it with local throwaway identity, demonstrates content-backed
  governed claims, and removes the fixture on exit.
- Command, package, architecture, root overview, and generated-site truth now describe
  the opt-in boundary, dependency direction, and no-fetch/no-write/no-provider
  constraints.

  anchors checked with zero failures.

## [Unreleased: cross-platform orientation proof] — 2026-07-26

Affects repository proof automation and CI only. No package version, public command,
publication, deployment, or generated workspace behavior changes in this slice.

### Added

- Added one disposable orientation runner, implemented without third-party Python
  imports and using Node, uvx, and Git for the real transport and checkout proof, for
  `tropo map → create-vivary adopt → create-vivary doctor → tropo find` loop across
  current, legacy flat-layout, brownfield, already-adopted, divergent-checkout, and
  corrupt fixtures.
- Exercised the Python and npm entry points together, with strict normalized-JSON
  parity, dry-run-before-apply enforcement, exact mutation allowlists, post-apply
  adopt idempotence, Git branch/HEAD/ref preservation, bounded read-only map/find checks,
  and honest Doctor compatibility results.
- Added a sanitized aggregate JSON receipt with command, version, fixture fingerprint,
  expected/actual mutation, parity, Doctor, retrieval, and Git-preservation evidence.
  CI runs the proof independently on `ubuntu-latest` and `windows-latest` and uploads
  each receipt even when a fixture fails.

### Verification

- `python packages/create-vivary/tests/test_orientation_proof.py` — **7/7** focused
  runner and receipt regressions passed.
- `python packages/create-vivary/tests/orientation_proof.py --receipt
  orientation-proof.json` — all **6/6**
  fixtures passed on Windows with real Python and npm transports.
- `cd site && npm run sync-docs && npm run build` — **23** documentation pages built

  legacy files remain explicitly allowlisted.
- `python scripts/check_package_docs_parity.py` — package documentation matches all
  **6** published manifests and the one explicit unpublished allowlist.
- `git diff --check origin/dev` — clean.

## [Unreleased: create-vivary npm adopt dispatch] — 2026-07-26

Affects `@vivary/create` argv transport, launcher coverage, and package documentation.
No package version, Python command behavior, publication, or deployment changes occur
in this slice.

### Fixed

- Made the npm launcher a shell-free transport that forwards argv unchanged to the
  canonical Python CLI, which solely owns command recognition and bare-name-to-`init`
  normalization.
- Added launcher coverage for raw passthrough of all five documented public command
  names, runner fallback and status propagation, both-runner error reporting, package
  pins, and shell-free stdio inheritance.
- Kept Python-only coverage for bare-name normalization and every canonical public
  subcommand, without requiring Node.

### Verification

- Node launcher coverage exercises raw explicit, bare, and leading-flag passthrough;
  uvx/pipx success and nonzero propagation; both-runner stderr; pinned package args;
  and shell-free stdio-inherited spawning.
- Python launcher coverage exercises bare-target-to-`init` normalization and explicit
  handling for every canonical public subcommand without invoking Node.

## [Unreleased: Bellamente predecessor contract and semantic adapter truth] — 2026-07-26

Affects public documentation, its generated website mirror, future implementation
contracts, and the source checkout's unreleased `vivary-memory-cognee` 0.1.1 privacy
floor. The published release remains 0.1.0; no provider call, memory mutation, MCP,
install, version, publication, or deployment action occurs.

### Changed

- Reconciled [#160](https://github.com/vivary-dev/vivary/pull/160) as the normative
  predecessor to #190: Bellamente remains an independent, workspace-local AgentLTM;
  Tropo-backed semantic adapters and the provider-neutral `vivary-core` candidate
  firewall are separate seams; learned memory never silently becomes authored truth.
- Locked explicit opt-in before any disabled AgentLTM policy is created, the complete
  fail-closed private set, truthful declarative capability and Doctor behavior, and
  separate human gates for install, activation, MCP enablement, every mutation, and
  release dogfood. Ordinary scaffold/adopt runs create no AgentLTM surface; selected
  output is disabled policy and inert instructions only.
- Corrected `docs/SEMANTIC-MEMORY.md` to match the shipped asynchronous Cognee adapter:
  the adapter owns privacy-filtered snapshot construction, indexing refreshes the
  whole dataset, recall accepts only known-node typed hits, forget removes the whole
  approved dataset, and Doctor remains module-level and provider-free.
  Recall documentation now names Cognee's fixed `source = "provider"` label, with the
  package contract test asserting that value.
  Current Doctor ordering is now explicit: `unavailable` short-circuits state-path
  validation, so that status does not attest path safety.
- Routed the nested Bellamente contract from the documentation index and the generated
  semantic-memory page without creating an unsupported site route.
- Made `docs/bellamente-memory/SPEC-bellamente-memory.md` the sole owner of the
  physical-store/persisted-payload, private-set, Doctor-state, normalized-input, and
  firewall-result contracts; the ADR, glossary, and core package README now route
  instead of restating them. It pins accepted
  exact-duplicate preserve and independent-evidence corroboration evaluations, plus
  accepted no-match evaluation with empty `reason_codes`; `review_required` outcomes
  for explicit correction, unresolved identity, and value conflict; and rejected
  stale, provider-degraded, or unfingerprinted inputs.
- The source checkout's unreleased adapter floor includes `.strato/private/**` and now
  matches privacy paths case-insensitively on Windows, with snapshot-level regression
  coverage. Public docs distinguish that behavior from published 0.1.0. The remaining
  escaped/complex Git-ignore limitation stays explicit and tracked by
  [#236](https://github.com/vivary-dev/vivary/issues/236).
- **create-vivary Doctor compatibility (#199)** — Doctor now distinguishes the strict
  15-path v0.1 common contract from legacy flat and v0.2+ indexed module layouts.
  Valid published workspaces receive preset-preserving, read-only upgrade
  recommendations, including actionable warnings for newer privacy-ignore lines they
  predate. Partial modern indexes, common root/runtime-skill gaps, and privacy gaps
  owned by each declared semantic-memory profile remain errors. The versioned
  `compatibility` report is schema version 1.
- **Declared configuration integrity (#199)** — Doctor validates recognized published
  and current embedded/cloud storage and local/Cognee memory profiles, including every
  field in the generated current profile without rejecting the narrower published
  v0.3.1 memory profile. It rejects empty declared storage strings, unknown cloud
  providers, privacy downgrades below the published floor, and enabled
  `memory.provider = "none"`, while preserving graph/trend metrics when a declared
  optional-memory config is malformed.
- **Indexed repair recognition (#237 follow-up)** — `doctor --repair` now recognizes
  either surviving indexed module-contract marker, so losing `modules/index.md` alone
  does not block unrelated conservative repairs.

### Verification

- `python packages/memory-cognee/tests/test_memory_cognee.py` — **50/50** adapter
  tests passed.
- `cd site && npm run test:site` — **8/8** site tests passed.
- `cd site && npm run build && npm run test:links` — **23** pages built; **1,644**
  local references and **1,018** anchors checked with zero failures.
- `python scripts/check_line_endings.py --verbose` — **231** tracked text files
  checked; **8** legacy files remain explicitly allowlisted.
- `git diff --check origin/dev...HEAD` — clean.
- Rendered `/semantic-memory/` browser smoke — all three seams, current/future
  divergence, absolute Bellamente contract link, published-0.1.0 versus unreleased
  privacy behavior, Windows matching, the #236 link, and no horizontal overflow
  verified.

## [Unreleased: vivary-core, the governed-context seam] — 2026-07-26

Introduced `vivary-core`, an in-repo library under `packages/core/`. It was not
published to PyPI or reachable from a shipping CLI in this initial slice; the first
outward adapter is recorded in the later Tropo governed-context entry above. No
existing package changed its published version here. The in-repo `vivary-core`
version is **0.2.0**. Nothing
about installing or running Vivary changed in this slice.
Publishing remains a manual human gate. No package publishes before the comprehensive
coordinated release train is complete and separately approved.

### Added

- `vivary-core` — the shared seam the role packages will speak through, so "what is
  true, and how do we know" has one implementation rather than four that drift.
  Canonical JSON, sha256 fingerprints and deterministic IDs; read-only checkout
  observation over explicit allowlisted roots; projection into a typed evidence graph
  where divergent checkouts stay unresolved conflicts with both sides preserved;
  bounded task capsules where every claim carries its evidence and selection reason;
  and receipts bound to the exact capsule and workspace fingerprint they ran against.
  Documented in [the architecture page](/architecture/). (Site-absolute route, not a
  repo-relative path: `CHANGELOG.md` is mirrored to `/changelog/`, where `docs/…`
  would resolve against that route and 404. Same convention the docs pages use.)
- `scripts/check_package_docs_parity.py` — a CI guard that derives the published-package
  list on [the architecture page](/architecture/) from `packages/*/pyproject.toml` plus
  one explicit `UNPUBLISHED` allowlist, so documented package truth cannot drift behind
  the manifests again. It caught two published packages missing from that list on the
  very commit that introduced it. Covered by `scripts/tests/test_package_docs_parity.py`
  (10 cases), which pins the wrapping behaviour of that prose bullet — reading only its
  first physical line would report wrapped names as missing and redden CI on a correct
  doc.
- Completed the in-core reference surfaces for the four role layers without wiring
  them into shipping CLIs: Strato owns fail-closed budgets, capsule/receipt gates, and
  loop transitions; Ozone owns receipt-integrity verdicts, gate sufficiency, and
  bounded gated repair proposals; Exo owns claims, leases, handoffs, dependencies,
  execution evidence, and task views; Bellamente owns the SPEC-owned
  candidate-recall firewall: accepted evaluations and gated review-only
  corrections preserve authored truth. The canonical architecture page and its
  generated site mirror now describe these surfaces explicitly.

### Changed

- **Recorded the selected dependency direction for `vivary-core`** — the first
  acceptance criterion of [#207](https://github.com/vivary-dev/vivary/issues/207). Role
  packages depend on core; the `vivary` meta package receives it transitively and does
  not declare it, so there is one owner per edge and no version-pinning fight. The edge
  is added to a role's `pyproject.toml` in the *same commit* that makes that role first
  import `vivary_core`, never ahead of it. That is why no role manifest depends on
  `vivary-core` yet: no role imports it, and a dependency nothing uses is a declaration
  the code does not support. Recorded on [the architecture page](/architecture/) and in
  the release workflow's bump table.
- The architecture page's PyPI list named four packages while six are published. It now
  also names `vivary` and `vivary-memory-cognee`, and says plainly that `vivary-core`
  remains unpublished during development and publishes only in the final comprehensive
  coordinated release train. The seam description stopped asserting in the present
  tense that every role package speaks through core — none does yet.
- The architecture opening, root agent contract, root README, and create-vivary
  PyPI/npm package copy now state Vivary's settled standard/scaffolder and
  governed-context descriptions directly instead of using the retired
  `create-t3-app` comparison.
- The release workflow now treats core as the library it is: its manifest is the sole
  in-repo version declaration, it ships in the same final release train as its
  dependent roles while uploading first inside that train, the `vivary` meta package
  uploads after its component floors, and registry smokes prove both direct core and
  meta-package installs expose `vivary_core` with the expected distribution versions.
- The edited root README, release workflow, and generated release-workflow mirror are
  now LF-normalized, and their retired legacy line-ending allowlist entries are gone.
- The lean root verification block now includes the core suite and current observed
  counts for the four fast local package suites; exhaustive jobs remain CI-owned.

### Fixed

Findings from the `vivary-core` review, all pre-release and none user-reachable:

- **Git environment injection.** Observation dropped four `GIT_*` variables, so
  command-scope config (`GIT_CONFIG_COUNT` / `GIT_CONFIG_KEY_*` / `GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_*`)
  could make a repository with no remotes observe as having an attacker-supplied
  origin — which then became the repository identity used for grouping, conflicts and
  fingerprints. The environment is now pinned rather than filtered.
- **Credential disclosure.** A remote URL embedding credentials was stored verbatim as
  both a fact and the repository identity, reaching observations, graphs, capsules and
  fingerprints. Userinfo is now stripped before storage.
- **Remote-less repositories are first-class.** Identity fell back to the checkout
  path, so each linked worktree of a repository without a remote became its own
  repository node and their divergence never surfaced. Identity now falls back to
  Git's common directory, which every linked worktree shares.
- **Capsule scope is enforced, not decorative.** `task.scope` was copied into the
  output but never applied, so a capsule could declare one scope and carry claims,
  conflicts and unknowns from outside it.
- **Content evidence is bound to the snapshot it was observed at**, so an excerpt from
  an earlier scan can no longer be presented as evidence about a later state.
- **Failed content searches are visible.** A search that could not run was
  indistinguishable from a search that found nothing.
- **Required checks are derived, not hardcoded.** Every workspace was told to run
  `npm test`, `npx create-vivary doctor` and `entire status`. Checks are now derived
  from observed markers with their evidence attached, an undeterminable test command
  is reported as an unknown rather than guessed, and `task.required_checks` overrides.
- Windows allowlist paths compare case-insensitively; a corrupt symbolic HEAD reports
  `unknown` instead of "detached"; the git output bound is enforced while the process
  runs rather than after; search terms are matched as fixed strings, not regexes; and
  negative claim budgets fail closed instead of silently widening the capsule.
- **Equivalent Win32 device paths share one claim scope.** Extended-length drive
  and UNC spellings can no longer acquire a second claim over a tree already
  covered by its ordinary drive or UNC path.
- **Duplicate Ozone check names preserve the worst evidence.** A later passing
  entry can no longer erase an earlier failed or skipped result for the same
  required check.
- **Malformed configured loop budgets fail closed.** Non-numeric, boolean,
  `NaN`, and infinite limits or counters exhaust the affected dimension with
  deterministic typed details; omission remains the only unbounded form.
- **Capsule compilation, gate validation, and budget validation agree on shape.**
  Capsule IDs, capsule fingerprints, and workspace fingerprints are mandatory;
  non-dict graph nodes or facts are rejected instead of being partially compiled.
- **Ozone keeps optional constraints and binding failures distinct.** An explicit
  null claim-verification constraint remains absent, while a partial capsule cannot
  produce a `sufficient` verdict. A receipt whose own capsule/workspace bindings are
  incomplete reports the new pinned `missing_binding` reason instead of masquerading
  as a mismatch with a supplied capsule.
- **Strato verifies receipts and bound Ozone verdicts before clearing a gate.**
  Receipt fingerprints and deterministic IDs are recomputed. Verdict fingerprints,
  bindings, typed projections, and outcome consistency are checked. Genuine
  non-sufficient early verdicts bound to the same receipt keep their actual Ozone
  reasons; a receiptless non-sufficient verdict supplied later with a receipt yields
  `verdict_binding_mismatch`. A `sufficient` verdict also requires a verified receipt
  outcome and projections matching the bound capsule and receipt. Forged verdicts use
  the pinned `verdict_integrity_mismatch` reason.
- **The Bellamente recall firewall rejects replay and mismatched corrections.**
  Typed evidence requires stable references and self-recomputable fingerprints;
  reordered or duplicated evidence cannot claim independent corroboration. Explicit
  unresolved-identity markers preserve opaque provider references and stop at
  `identity_unresolved`; they never reach comparison or mutation paths. Explicit
  corrections whose predicate or scope differs from the named target use the pinned
  `correction_target_mismatch` review reason.
- **Receipt construction refuses unusable evidence at the source.** Incomplete
  capsule/workspace bindings and missing, empty, or non-string runtime actors raise
  `ValueError` instead of producing a receipt that can never verify.
- **Exo fails closed on malformed caller-owned control state.** Handoffs and
  execution edges recheck receipt integrity; inverted leases are refused, malformed
  persisted leases are quarantined with `unknown_lease_shape`, and malformed claim
  ledgers are refused or quarantined with `unknown_claim_shape`. Duplicate task IDs
  invalidate a dependency graph instead of being resolved last-write-wins. Truthy
  non-dict scope, request, dependency, capsule, or receipt inputs produce typed
  refusals (or `ValueError` for invalid dependency graphs) instead of uncaught errors.

### Verification

- `python -m pytest packages/core/tests/ -q` — **589 passed**.
- `uv run --isolated --no-project --no-cache --with ./packages/core python -c
  "from importlib.metadata import version; import vivary_core; assert
  version('vivary-core') == '0.2.0'"` — local wheel-equivalent import and distribution
  metadata smoke passed.
- `python scripts/tests/test_package_docs_parity.py` — **10/10 passed**.
- `python scripts/check_package_docs_parity.py` — architecture matches **6** published
  manifests with **1** deliberately unpublished distribution allowlisted.
- `python scripts/check_line_endings.py --verbose` — **256** tracked text files checked;
  **8** legacy files remain explicitly allowlisted.
- `git check-attr whitespace --` with `docs/RELEASE-WORKFLOW.md`,
  `site/src/content/docs/release-workflow.md`, `README.md`, and
  `site/src/pages/index.astro` — all four preserve Git's whitespace checks while
  treating CRLF's `\r` as part of the line ending.
- `git diff --check origin/dev` — clean across the complete branch plus local remediation.
- `cd site && npm run test:site && npm run build && npm run test:links` — **8/8** site
  tests; **23** pages built; **1,644** local references and **1,018** anchors checked
  with zero failures.

## [Unreleased: guided doctor repair and truthful map counts] — 2026-07-25

Affects `create-vivary` / `@vivary/create` and `vivary-tropo`. Published versions stay
at **0.3.1** and **0.4.1** in this entry; the bumps are deferred to the unified release
line tracked in #149, where `create-vivary` / `@vivary/create` take a **minor** and
`vivary-tropo` a **patch**. `strato` is versionless and rides the create-vivary train.
Publishing remains a manual human gate.

### Added

- `create-vivary doctor --repair` — a guided, conservative repair plan. Dry-run by
  default; `--yes` applies only deterministic safe repairs, reruns doctor, and keeps a
  nonzero exit if the workspace is still invalid. Safe repairs are limited to
  regenerating missing private/runtime placeholders from the canonical templates,
  appending missing privacy ignore lines, and removing simple single-line W210
  redundant derived metadata.
- `create-vivary doctor --trend` — opt-in drift tracking against a prior recorded run.

### Fixed

- **Privacy probes now match `.gitignore` the way Git does.** The matcher used
  `fnmatchcase`, so `*` crossed `/`, `**/` and `/**` were not honoured, directory rules
  like `.strato/*/` never matched, and an excluded directory did not exclude its
  contents. Doctor could therefore report a leaking workspace as clean — including the
  `!**/USER.md` case, which stayed green even after the first nested-negation fix
  because that fix inherited the same matcher bug.
- **A backslash in a `.gitignore` pattern is treated as Git's escape character, not a
  path separator.** `USER.md\ ` names the file "USER.md " — with the space — so it does
  not protect `USER.md`, but the parser stripped the trailing space unconditionally and
  rewrote the backslash to `/`, crediting the rule and reporting the workspace clean.
- **A bracket expression is no longer credited with protecting a private file.**
  `[U]SER.md` is honoured only where `core.ignorecase` is off, so on the default
  Windows and macOS configuration such a rule silently protects nothing. Positive rules
  that depend on case folding now fail closed; negations spelled that way are still
  honoured, so an unignore is never missed.
- **`doctor --repair --yes` converges.** It previously appended a duplicate privacy
  block on every run without ever fixing the workspace, because the planner predicted
  success using a different rule than doctor used to pass. Patterns an append provably
  cannot fix are now withheld from the safe list and reported as manual instead.
- **Nested `.gitignore` negations are reported, not papered over.** A lower-level rule
  that unignores a private path takes precedence in Git, so no root-level line can
  override it. Both `doctor` and `adopt` now say so and name the exposed paths, rather
  than recommending a root-level fix that cannot work — or, in adopt's case, answering
  a negation with another negation.
- **`doctor --repair` reports the real reason a W210 field was left for a human.**
  Every failure previously said "complex YAML", so a user whose file was non-UTF-8,
  hard-linked or unreadable was told to hand-edit YAML that was not the problem.
- **`doctor --repair` preserves file modes.** Atomic replacement went through
  `mkstemp`, which creates at `0600`, silently making an existing `0644` file
  owner-only on POSIX and breaking shared workspaces and service accounts.
- **Stale-scaffold cleanup no longer crashes.** A raw `OSError` from an unremovable
  path escaped the `init` error handler, producing a traceback and — under `--json` —
  no JSON at all. Directory reparse points are now removed with `rmdir`.
- **Private placeholders no longer crash on an undecodable template.**
  `UnicodeDecodeError` is a `ValueError`, so it slipped past the `OSError` handler and
  the repair apply loop alike.
- **`tropo map` counts hard-linked files.** They were skipped as though they were
  symlinks, which silently removed ordinary public files from totals, largest-file,
  index detection and module candidates. Symlinks and reparse points are still omitted;
  a hard link is an ordinary directory entry, not an alternate route to already-counted
  content. `map` counts paths and sums per-path sizes — it does not report disk usage.
- Documented the full privacy ignore set in `docs/COMMANDS.md`. Three enforced lines
  (`*.vivary-tmp`, `!memory/.gitkeep`, `!heartbeat-reports/.gitkeep`) appeared nowhere
  in the docs, so a user following them could not make the post-adopt check pass. A
  test now derives the expectation from the code so the two cannot drift again.

## [Unreleased: Vivary product identity and proof spine] — 2026-07-18

Affects documentation, site verification, and the website only. No package versions
change.

### Added

- Added a distinct Vivary visual identity with an abstract strata-and-gate mark,
  living-world hero illustration, and architecture-layer asset.
- Added a full-length technical white paper defining the workspace failure mode,
  terminology, requirements, system invariants, architecture, operating protocol,
  threat model, evidence ledger, limitations, governance, and reproducible evaluation
  standard, grounded in primary references.
- Added the white paper to the generated Starlight documentation and
  machine-readable docs surfaces.

### Changed

- Rebuilt the public homepage around the brownfield adoption path, product thesis,
  four-layer architecture, measurable proof, and quiet company endorsement.
- Reframed the canonical repo roadmap around comprehension, adoption, retention, and
  evidence loops, then surfaced it as a first-class website page outside the guides.
- Replaced the long-form docs FAQ with concise homepage answers about adoption,
  privacy, lock-in, optional providers, and the current evidence boundary.
- Replaced the generic blog backlog with a proof-led content system tied to runnable
  commands, canonical docs, and repeat use; the plan remains repo-only.
- Preserved the static support-report flow through the redesigned homepage, aligned
  the blog and docs favicon/mark surfaces, repaired generated-site link rewrites, and
  brought the security policy's supported package lines up to current registry truth.

### Verification

- `cd site && npm audit`
- `cd site && npm run test:site`
- `cd site && npm run sync-docs`
- `cd site && npm run build`
- Desktop and mobile browser checks, primary-link checks, command-copy interaction,
  FAQ disclosure checks, roadmap-page checks, and console review.

## [Unreleased: stored vector query] — 2026-07-06

Affects `vivary-tropo` query behavior and docs. This is not published yet.

### Added

- `tropo query --mode vector` now prefers current stored vectors from embedded
  storage when `.vivary/storage.toml` enables local-hash embeddings and the embedded
  backend has migrated rows.
- Vector JSON now reports whether results came from `source: "stored"`,
  `source: "computed"`, or `source: "text"` fallback, plus embedded index metadata
  when stored rows are used.

### Changed

- The dependency-free local-hash vector shape is now `local-hash-v2`, adding a small
  prefix/character feature signal so local vector search can catch simple wording
  drift such as `verify` matching `verification`.

### Fixed

- Stored vector query refuses stale, partial, deleted, old-version, or
  dimension-mismatched embedded rows and falls back to deterministic typed text
  results with an explicit `detail`.
- Stored vector query now validates compact metadata before fetching bounded vector
  candidates, so huge or corrupt embedded tables do not silently force full-table
  vector materialization.
- Embedded storage config now rejects malformed `[storage.embedded]` values,
  out-of-root paths, and symlink/junction-backed storage paths before backend writes.
- Backend vector-search failures now fall back to typed text results with redacted
  diagnostics instead of being reported as healthy stored-vector search.
- Stored vector query keeps the existing type, path, edge, snippet, `--k`, and
  `--explain` result shape, including Windows-style path globs.

### Verification

- `python packages/tropo/tests/test_tropo.py`
- Real LanceDB dogfood: fresh `create-vivary init ... --preset coding --storage
  embedded --provider lancedb --auto --yes --json`, local-hash embedding enablement,
  file-to-embedded migration, stored vector query with `source: "stored"`, stale
  `source_fingerprint` fallback after editing a source file, re-migration, and
  Windows-style path/edge filter query.
- Wording-drift proof: text query for `verify` returned no results after removing the
  exact word, while stored vector query returned the `verification` node after
  re-migration.
- Timing smoke on the dogfood workspace: 8 in-process loops for text and stored-vector
  query paths to catch obvious regressions. Release-grade benchmark work remains
  tracked separately.
- Adversarial review hardening: added regression coverage for malformed embedded
  storage config, out-of-root storage paths, case-insensitive Windows path redaction,
  all-deleted stale rows, non-finite vectors, backend vector-search failure, and
  candidate limiting for large `--k`.

## [Unreleased: embedded typed-node embeddings] — 2026-07-06

Affects `vivary-tropo` migration behavior and docs. This is not published yet.

### Added

- `tropo migrate --from file --to embedded --json` now reports an `embedding` object.
- When `.vivary/storage.toml` explicitly enables `[storage.embedding]` with
  `provider = "local-hash"`, embedded migration stores graph-shaped vectors on typed
  node rows, plus source and embedding fingerprints for stale-vector detection.

### Fixed

- Nested `tropo.toml` `exclude` rules now filter analysis candidates after overlay
  resolution, so private nested notes are not analyzed or embedded.
- Invalid embedding config fails before backend writes during real migration; dry-run
  migration remains conservative and write-free.
- Real embedded migration now replaces the node snapshot, preventing deleted,
  renamed, newly excluded, or vector-schema-changed nodes from leaving stale rows.

### Verification

- `python packages/tropo/tests/test_tropo.py`
- Fresh scaffold dogfood: `create-vivary init ... --preset coding --storage embedded
  --provider lancedb --auto --yes --json`, followed by plain embedded migration,
  explicit local-hash embedding enablement, rerun migration, and LanceDB row-shape
  inspection.
- Brownfield dogfood: `create-vivary adopt ... --preset coding --yes --json`,
  explicit embedded/local-hash storage config, migration, and LanceDB row-shape
  inspection.
- Real LanceDB idempotence smoke: repeated migration kept row count stable while
  preserving 64-dimension vectors and embedding/source fingerprints.

## [Unreleased: local receipt log viewer] — 2026-07-05

Affects the `vivary` meta package, CLI docs, package docs, and generated website
docs. This is not published yet; the `vivary` version bump and registry publish remain
release-train gates.

### Added

- Added the dependency-free `vivary` helper CLI to the meta package.
- Added `vivary logs [PATH]` to summarize local JSONL run receipts as text or JSON.
- Added `vivary logs email [PATH] --to ...` to create a local `.eml` support draft or
  print a `mailto:` URL from whitelisted receipt fields.
- Added a dependency-free website support modal with copy-email, copy-report, prefilled
  `mailto:`, and GitHub issue fallbacks. The modal opens automatically for browser
  errors noticed by the site and omits local `file://` paths from generated reports.
- Pointed the website support flow at the bug issue form and set the form to assign
  new bug reports to the maintainer account for GitHub notifications.

### Security

- `vivary logs` copies only receipt schema/tool/version/command/flags/count/status/timing
  and runtime envelope fields. Unknown fields, stdout/stderr-like fields, file contents,
  raw query text, target ids, and local paths are not included in summaries or email
  drafts.
- `vivary logs email --out` refuses directory targets, symlink targets,
  symlink/junction ancestor directories, and Windows device names.
- Vivary still never sends telemetry or email itself; users send the local draft with
  their own mail client if they choose.
- The website support modal is static-only and does not call SendGrid, Resend, SMTP, or
  any other email provider.

### Verification

- `python packages/vivary/tests/test_vivary_cli.py`
- `cd site && npm run test:support`
- Real receipt smoke: `tropo check --root packages/tropo/examples/vault --receipt
  sandboxes/observability-proof/receipts.jsonl`, then `vivary logs ... --json` and
  `vivary logs email ... --out ... --json`.

## [Unreleased: repo line-ending standard] — 2026-07-05

Affects contributor docs, PR hygiene, and CI only. No package behavior changed.

### Added

- Added `.gitattributes`, `.editorconfig`, and `scripts/check_line_endings.py` as the
  repo standard for LF-normalized text files across Windows, WSL/Linux, and GitHub
  Actions.
- Added the line-ending check to CI, the PR template, and contributor guidance, with
  an explicit temporary allowlist for legacy mixed/CRLF files that should be reduced
  through deliberate cleanup PRs.

## [Unreleased: retrieval mode docs polish] — 2026-07-05

Affects public docs, generated website docs, and the `vivary-tropo` package README
only. No package behavior changed.

### Changed

- Added a plain-English chooser for `tropo query` retrieval modes so users know when
  to stay with default text search, when local vector ranking is useful, and when
  optional provider-backed semantic recall is required.

## [Unreleased: getting-started proof walkthrough] — 2026-07-05

Affects public docs and generated website docs only. No private dogfood workspace,
package release, or provider runtime call is included.

### Added

- Added `docs/WALKTHROUGH.md`, a public, generic proof of the first Vivary product
  cycle: scaffold, doctor health, `tropo check`, `ozone review`, `exo board`, and
  `ozone impact`.
- Added sanitized SVG terminal captures under `docs/assets/walkthrough/` and copied
  docs assets into the generated site build.
- Added the walkthrough to the website sidebar, docs index, getting-started next links,
  and generated LLM documentation surfaces.

### Verification

- Generic disposable proof workspace: `create-vivary init`, `doctor`, `tropo check`,
  `ozone review`, `exo board`, and `ozone impact human-gates` all completed without
  private paths in the public artifacts.
- `cd site && npm run build`

## [Unreleased: tropo typed vector query mode] — 2026-07-05

Affects `vivary-tropo`, CLI docs, package docs, and generated website docs. This is
not published yet; the `vivary-tropo` version bump and registry publish remain
release-train gates.

### Added

- Added `tropo query --mode vector`, a dependency-free local typed-vector search mode
  over analyzed tropo graph nodes.
- Added explicit `.vivary/storage.toml` opt-in for local vectors via `[storage.embedding]
  enabled = true`, `provider = "local-hash"`, and optional `dimensions`.
- Kept vector results graph-shaped: typed node ids, paths, types, scores, provider
  markers, snippets, and type/path/edge filters are preserved.
- This is a local query-time vector slice only; it does not add stored embeddings,
  ANN search over an embedded backend, or clustering/community graph views.

### Hardened

- `--mode vector` falls back to dependency-free text graph search when no embedding
  config is present instead of failing or installing anything.
- Invalid embedding config is reported as structured `misconfigured` JSON without
  attempting provider calls, network access, or package installation.
- Malformed storage config reports relative `.vivary/storage.toml` details instead of
  absolute local paths, and `tropo migrate --to embedded` refuses to silently use the
  file backend when embedded storage is not configured.

### Verification

- `python packages/tropo/tests/test_tropo.py`

## [Unreleased: tropo semantic query mode] — 2026-07-05

Affects `vivary-tropo`, `vivary-memory-cognee`, CLI docs, package docs, and
generated website docs. This is not published yet; registry publishes remain
release-train gates.

### Added

- Added `tropo query --mode semantic`, a dependency-free bridge to an explicitly
  configured optional semantic-memory provider. The default `text` mode is unchanged.
- Semantic query returns typed Vivary node ids from the provider instead of opaque
  chunks, and reports a structured unavailable state when semantic memory is not
  configured, installed, or indexed.

### Hardened

- Scoped real Cognee runtime state/log/cache directories to the workspace
  `memory.cognee.state_path` before provider import.
- Enforced `memory.cognee.allow_network = true` before Cognee provider runtime calls
  so generated Cognee policy cannot accidentally index or recall through embedding/LLM
  providers.
- Required either `memory.cognee.api_key_env` or explicit
  `memory.cognee.allow_without_api_key = true` before provider runtime calls.
- Forced Cognee third-party telemetry/tracing off by default with
  `memory.cognee.allow_telemetry = false`, even when inherited environment variables
  try to enable tracing, while still allowing an explicit opt-in.
- Rejected invalid semantic-memory TOML schema instead of coercing truthy strings or
  integers into safety gates.
- Refused semantic provider snapshots that resolve Markdown files outside the workspace
  through symlinks or Windows junctions, plus in-root linked or hard-linked Markdown
  files that could smuggle private content through a public path.
- Bound Cognee dataset names to the workspace path hash, even when a label is
  configured, so one workspace cannot accidentally forget another workspace's dataset.
- Made provider recall require a current manifest fingerprint, and made approved index
  replace the prior Cognee dataset before remembering current node packets.
- Made `vivary-cognee forget` request full dataset deletion instead of memory-only
  deletion, and made missing provider datasets idempotent under `--yes`.
- Refused nonexistent `vivary-cognee --root` targets instead of promoting typos to the
  nearest ancestor workspace before a mutating command.
- Refused linked or hard-linked Cognee manifest targets before writing local index
  proof, and preserved manifests when provider dataset deletion fails with permission
  or accessibility errors.
- Hardened `tropo query --mode semantic` against workspace-local `vivary_cognee.py`
  import hijacking while still allowing the repo adapter or installed adapters outside
  the workspace/current working tree.
- Bumped the unreleased `vivary-memory-cognee` adapter metadata to `0.1.1`, added an
  explicit adapter capability marker, and made `tropo query --mode semantic` refuse
  older adapters before calling provider recall.
- Honored nested `.gitignore` files and directory ignore patterns before building
  provider snapshots, so ignored private Markdown is not sent to the optional provider.
- Preflighted the local Cognee manifest path before any provider-side mutation, compared
  full manifest identity instead of fingerprint alone, and sanitized provider exception
  strings to action plus exception class.
- Capped semantic provider over-fetch for filtered queries so large `--k` values cannot
  fan out into unbounded provider requests before local filtering.
- Kept `vivary-cognee doctor` package-presence-only, avoiding Cognee import side
  effects, suppressed Cognee dotenv autoload during runtime import, and kept provider
  import/call chatter off JSON stdout for runtime commands.

### Verification

- `python packages/tropo/tests/test_tropo.py`
- `python packages/memory-cognee/tests/test_memory_cognee.py`
- CI packaged optional semantic bridge smoke installs local `vivary-tropo` plus
  `vivary-memory-cognee` with `--no-deps`, then verifies installed `tropo query
  --mode semantic --json` reaches the explicit `allow_network` gate without provider
  calls.
- Real installed `cognee 1.2.2` smoke: `vivary-cognee doctor --json` reported the
  installed package without importing provider runtime, `vivary-cognee index --dry-run
  --json` reported packet counts, and provider runtime calls were refused while
  `allow_network = false`.

## [Unreleased: local run receipts] — 2026-07-05

Affects `create-vivary`, `vivary-tropo`, `vivary-ozone`, `vivary-exo`, CLI docs,
package docs, and generated website docs. This is not published yet; package version
bumps and registry publishes remain release-train gates.

### Added

- Added dependency-free, opt-in local JSONL run receipts to the core CLIs via
  `--receipt PATH` or `VIVARY_RECEIPT_LOG=PATH`.
- Receipts record a small debug envelope: schema version, tool/version, command,
  flag names, argument count, exit code, duration, Python version, and platform.
- Receipts deliberately avoid stdout, stderr, environment variables, file contents,
  raw query text, target ids, local paths, graph content, preset values, and agent
  handles.

### Security

- Receipt targets must be regular files; symlink targets and directory targets are
  refused so an opt-in debug log cannot silently append through a suspicious path.
- Symlink or Windows junction directory ancestors are refused for receipt paths before
  and after parent directory creation.
- Windows device names such as `NUL`, `CON`, `COM1`, and `LPT1` are refused as
  receipt targets.

### Verification

- `python packages/tropo/tests/test_tropo.py`
- `python packages/ozone/tests/test_ozone.py`
- `python packages/exo/tests/test_exo.py`
- `python packages/create-vivary/tests/test_create_vivary.py`
- `python packages/create-vivary/tests/test_adopt.py`
- `python packages/create-vivary/tests/test_strato_integrity.py`
- `python packages/create-vivary/tests/test_assets_parity.py`

- `python packages/tropo/tropo.py check --root packages/tropo/examples/vault`
- `cd site && npm run sync-docs && npm run build`
- `cd packages/create-vivary/npm && npm pack --dry-run`
- `git diff --check`

## [Unreleased: vivary-ozone editorial pack] — 2026-07-05

Affects `vivary-ozone`, CLI docs, package docs, and generated website docs. This is
not published yet; the `vivary-ozone` version bump and registry publish remain a
later release-train gate.

### Added

- Added `ozone review --pack editorial`, a deterministic writing-workspace rule pack
  that demonstrates the "code review and editorial review are the same layer with
  different rule packs" thesis.
- The pack flags missing draft/manuscript review coverage, missing edit/revision
  coverage, missing outline/structure coverage, and unlinked reviews or edits while
  staying quiet for non-writing workspaces.

### Verification

- `python packages/ozone/tests/test_ozone.py`

## [Release workflow / @vivary/create trusted publishing] — 2026-07-05

Affects GitHub Actions, release docs, and generated website docs only. No package
release, npm publish, or PyPI publish is implied.

### Added

- Added a manually dispatched, release-tag-gated GitHub Actions workflow for
  tokenless `@vivary/create` publishing through npm Trusted Publishing and the
  protected `npm-publish` environment.
- Added a CI guard that verifies the npm trusted publish workflow keeps OIDC
  permissions, package checks, dry-run behavior, and avoids token-based publishing.

### Changed

- `docs/RELEASE-WORKFLOW.md` now documents the policy-level trusted publisher setup
  for `@vivary/create` instead of public maintainer-specific npm auth steps.

### Verification

- `python scripts/check_npm_trusted_publish_workflow.py`
- `python packages/create-vivary/tests/test_assets_parity.py`
- `node packages/create-vivary/tests/test_npm_launcher.js`
- `python packages/create-vivary/tests/test_create_vivary.py`
- `cd site && npm run sync-docs && npm run build`
- `cd packages/create-vivary/npm && npm pack --dry-run` reported the expected
  three npm package files: `README.md`, `index.js`, and `package.json`.

## [Public stats snapshot] — 2026-07-05

Affects README/site public signals only. No package release, changelog-worthy
runtime change, npm publish, or PyPI publish is implied.

### Changed

- Refreshed the checked-in public signals snapshot: `@vivary/create` npm weekly
  downloads `344`, PyPI package weekly downloads `1467`, all package weekly
  downloads `1811`, GitHub stars `3`, forks `1`, and open issues `8`.
- The usage snapshot chart keeps the same fixed SVG canvas; the npm bar is shorter
  because bars are proportional to the largest package-source count in that
  snapshot, not because a badge or chart container was resized.

### Verification

- `stats/latest.json` reports `status: "ok"` with no stale-source warnings.
- `stats/history.csv` adds the `2026-07-05` row.
- `stats/usage-snapshot.svg` and `site/public/usage-snapshot.svg` match.

## [vivary 0.1.0] — 2026-07-04

Adds the `vivary` meta-package on PyPI: `pip install vivary` installs the full
CLI suite (`create-vivary`, `vivary-tropo`, `vivary-ozone`, `vivary-exo`) with
compatible minimum versions. No code of its own; the four packages stay
independently versioned and installable. Website and docs install commands
collapse to the one-liner; the homepage strip shows a single PyPI card.

### Verification

- Published and verified: `pip index versions vivary` returned `vivary (0.1.0)`
  from the public index after `twine upload`.

## [vivary-tropo 0.4.1 / create-vivary 0.3.1] — 2026-07-04

Affects `vivary-tropo`, `create-vivary` / `@vivary/create`, root docs, package docs,
generated website docs, and the homepage. The adoption-line release: Vivary now works
on existing repos and vaults, not just fresh scaffolds. Published and verified as
`vivary-tropo==0.4.1`, `create-vivary==0.3.1`, and `@vivary/create@0.3.1`:
cache-resistant `uvx --no-cache` installs from the public index self-report
`tropo 0.4.1` / `create-vivary 0.3.1`, and
`npx --yes @vivary/create@0.3.1 capabilities --preset coding --json` returns ok.

> Note: `vivary-tropo==0.4.0` and `create-vivary==0.3.0` exist on PyPI but
> self-report the previous version from a stale `__version__` constant; they are
> superseded by 0.4.1 / 0.3.1 (same content plus the constant fix and a
> version-parity test). `@vivary/create` skips 0.3.0 on npm entirely.

### Added

- **`tropo map`** (tropo 0.4.0) — read-only filesystem inventory of any repo, vault, or
  docs tree: directory table, extension/size summaries, largest files, existing
  index/routing surfaces, and likely-modules-without-an-index. Markdown by default,
  deterministic `--json`; workspace excludes honored (file-level and subtree-rebased),
  junction/symlink cycles pruned, no `tropo.toml` required.
- **`create-vivary adopt <path>`** (create-vivary 0.3.0) — brownfield adoption: dry-run
  by default, `--yes` write gate, only ever adds files (existing content stays
  byte-identical), candidate module routers for markdown-heavy directories, collision
  skip and report, privacy follow-ups for an existing `.gitignore`, and the 0.2.5
  symlink/out-of-root hardening. An adopted workspace passes `doctor` and `tropo check`.
- **`create-vivary doctor --trend`** (create-vivary 0.3.0) — opt-in drift tracking:
  prior-run state in `.vivary/doctor-state.json` (atomic, symlink-refusing writes),
  signed deltas for graph and routing metrics, corrupt state degrades to first-run with
  a visible `trend_warning` in `--json`. Plus a copy-paste GitHub Actions CI-gate
  recipe in `docs/HOWTO.md`.
- **Strato integrity gates** — scaffold smokes for all four presets, markdown
  cross-reference integrity, and Claude/Codex skills structural parity now run in CI.
  strato formally rides the create-vivary release train.

### Fixed

- Homepage mobile overflow (155px horizontal overflow at a 375px viewport) and a
  desktop hero width regression caught in review.
- The loops skill is runtime-honest: the Codex copy no longer claims Claude Code's
  `/loop` and `/goal`; one combined section covers both runtimes in all three copies.

### Changed

- `docs/PRODUCT-ROADMAP.md` restructured around the P1 adoption line;
  `docs/RELEASE-WORKFLOW.md` expanded into a detailed runbook (scope table, publish
  commands, verification smokes, social announcement step); `CONTRIBUTING.md`
  corrects the stale prod-branch claim.

### Verification

- tropo: 83/83 tests on Python 3.11 and 3.14 (68 pre-existing + 15 map).
- create-vivary: full suite green post-merge; init byte-parity vs 0.2.8 verified
  across five flag configurations by adversarial review; only-adds and dry-run purity
  verified against hostile fixtures.
- Adversarial review on every PR in the line (#98–#105) with findings fixed pre-merge.
- Publishing remains a manual human gate.

## [vivary-memory-cognee 0.1.0 / create-vivary 0.2.8] — 2026-06-27

Affects the optional Cognee adapter package, `create-vivary` / `@vivary/create`,
root docs, package docs, and generated website docs. Published and verified as
`vivary-memory-cognee==0.1.0`, `create-vivary==0.2.8`, and `@vivary/create@0.2.8`
after PR #93 merged to `dev`.

### Added

- **Optional Cognee memory adapter** — `packages/memory-cognee/` adds the
  `vivary-memory-cognee` package and `vivary-cognee` CLI with `doctor`, `index`,
  `recall`, and `forget`. It indexes privacy-filtered typed Tropo node packets and
  accepts only recall hits that map back to known Vivary node ids.

### Changed

- `create-vivary capabilities --json` now marks `memory:cognee` with
  `"adapter_status": "optional-package"` while keeping Cognee out of the default
  install path.
- `create-vivary` / `@vivary/create` move to 0.2.8 so the scaffolder and npm launcher
  publish the updated Cognee adapter metadata and docs together.

### Verification

- `python packages/memory-cognee/tests/test_memory_cognee.py` passed locally: 6/6.
- `python -m pip index versions create-vivary` reported `0.2.8`.
- `python -m pip index versions vivary-memory-cognee` reported `0.1.0`.
- `uvx --no-cache --index-url https://pypi.org/simple --from create-vivary==0.2.8 create-vivary --version`
  returned `create-vivary 0.2.8`.
- `uvx --no-cache --index-url https://pypi.org/simple --from vivary-memory-cognee==0.1.0 vivary-cognee --version`
  returned `vivary-cognee 0.1.0`.
- `npm view @vivary/create version` returned `0.2.8`.
- `npx --yes @vivary/create@0.2.8 capabilities --preset coding --json` completed
  through the published npm launcher and reported `memory:cognee` with
  `"adapter_status": "optional-package"`.

## [vivary-tropo 0.3.0 / vivary-ozone 0.2.0 / create-vivary 0.2.7] — 2026-06-27

Affects `vivary-tropo`, `vivary-ozone`, `create-vivary` / `@vivary/create`, root
docs, package docs, and generated website docs. Published and verified as
`vivary-tropo==0.3.0`, `vivary-ozone==0.2.0`, `create-vivary==0.2.7`, and
`@vivary/create@0.2.7` after PR #91 merged to `dev`.

### Added

- **`tropo find` context packets** — a human-friendly command that returns the small
  set of typed nodes/files worth opening first, with reasons, snippets, filters, JSON
  output, and an approximate token budget.
- **Ozone `context-budget` pack** — `ozone review --pack context-budget` flags
  context-bloat risks in public routing surfaces: missing module indexes, legacy
  module files that coexist with directory indexes, oversized always-on files,
  oversized module indexes, bulk-load wording, and duplicated routing blocks.
- **Ozone pack selection** — `ozone review --pack structure|context-budget|all`
  keeps the default `structure` behavior stable while allowing opt-in context-budget
  review. `--strict` still exits non-zero only on `warn` findings.
- **Local checkout CLI refresh** — `scripts/install-local-clis.ps1` uninstalls existing
  Vivary uv tools, then installs the current branch's CLIs without `--force`, preventing
  stale global tools from silently testing older behavior during local review.
- **LLM active-context guide** — `docs/LLM-ACTIVE-CONTEXT.md` and the generated website
  page provide a compact, copyable graph-first CocoIndex-code retrieval prompt.
- **Product roadmap** — `docs/PRODUCT-ROADMAP.md` captures the high-leverage backlog
  for large filesystem maps, module index planning, structured content query, typed
  recall providers, optional integration proof, and context-budget repair workflows.

### Changed

- **`tropo query` is graph-aware** — query now searches analyzed Tropo nodes instead
  of raw Markdown files, returning real graph ids/types/paths and supporting `--type`,
  `--path`, `--edge`, `--snippet`, and `--explain`.
- **Active-context guidance is simpler and stricter about CocoIndex path filters** —
  the generated skill and docs now lead with `tropo find`, use exact
  `ccc search --path` examples, and warn that broad folder globs can miss indexed files
  in current CocoIndex-code releases.
- **LanceDB wording is storage-first** — public docs, wizard copy, and capability
  labels now describe LanceDB as explicit embedded storage, while `tropo find` and
  `tropo query` remain graph-first zero-dependency retrieval commands.
- **Package dependency floor moved with retrieval guidance** — `create-vivary` and
  `vivary-ozone` now depend on `vivary-tropo>=0.3.0` so installed scaffolds and review
  docs reference a tropo version that includes `find` and graph-aware `query`.

### Verification

- `python packages/tropo/tests/test_tropo.py` passed locally: 68/68.
- `python packages/ozone/tests/test_ozone.py` passed locally: 16/16.
- `python packages/create-vivary/tests/test_create_vivary.py` passed locally: 54/54.
- `python packages/create-vivary/tests/test_assets_parity.py` passed locally: 3/3.
- `python packages/exo/tests/test_exo.py` passed locally: 14/14.
- `cd site && npm run sync-docs && npm run build` passed locally.
- Local CLI refresh passed with `scripts/install-local-clis.ps1`, then bare `tropo`,
  `ozone`, `exo`, and `create-vivary` smokes passed.
- Disposable LanceDB, CocoIndex-code, and Cognee-policy smokes passed locally. Cognee
  remains policy-only in Vivary; the actual optional adapter is not shipped in this
  release.
- `uvx --no-cache --index-url https://pypi.org/simple --from vivary-tropo==0.3.0 tropo --version`
  returned `tropo 0.3.0` from public PyPI.
- `uvx --no-cache --index-url https://pypi.org/simple --from vivary-ozone==0.2.0 ozone --version`
  returned `ozone 0.2.0` from public PyPI.
- `uvx --no-cache --index-url https://pypi.org/simple --from create-vivary==0.2.7 create-vivary --version`
  returned `create-vivary 0.2.7` from public PyPI.
- `npm view @vivary/create version` returned `0.2.7`, and
  `npx --yes @vivary/create@0.2.7 capabilities --preset coding --json` completed
  through the published npm launcher.

## [create-vivary 0.2.6] — 2026-06-26

Affects `create-vivary` / `@vivary/create`, generated workspace docs, and public docs.
Published and verified as `create-vivary==0.2.6` on PyPI and `@vivary/create@0.2.6`
on npm after PR #87 merged to `dev`.

### Added

- **`knowledge-work` preset** — a generic workbench for sources, artifacts, decisions,
  and proof, with editable `workbench` and `sources` module routers.
- **Capability discovery** — `create-vivary capabilities [--preset ...] [--json]`
  lists optional storage, semantic-memory, and preset-specific sidecar capabilities for
  human and agent setup flows.
- **Optional semantic-memory setup** — `create-vivary init` / `wizard` now accept
  `--memory none|local|cognee`. `local` writes local-only semantic-memory policy;
  `cognee` writes Cognee policy, graph docs, and verification surfaces without
  installing Cognee, indexing content, enabling network access, or using API keys.
- **Doctor memory reporting** — `create-vivary doctor` reports semantic-memory status
  as disabled, healthy/configured, unavailable, misconfigured, or privacy-failed.

### Changed

- The npm launcher recognizes the new `capabilities` subcommand instead of rewriting it
  to `init`.

### Verification

- `python -m pip index versions create-vivary` reported `LATEST: 0.2.6`.
- A fresh venv installed `create-vivary==0.2.6` from PyPI and ran
  `create-vivary capabilities --preset knowledge-work --json`.
- `npm view @vivary/create version` reported `0.2.6`.
- `npx --yes @vivary/create@0.2.6 capabilities --preset knowledge-work --json`
  ran through the published npm launcher and matching PyPI scaffolder.

## [vivary-tropo 0.2.3 / vivary-exo 0.2.2 / create-vivary 0.2.5] — 2026-06-23

Affects `vivary-tropo`, `vivary-exo`, `create-vivary` / `@vivary/create`,
`strato` workspace assets, and public docs/site release surfaces. This package set
ships the merged security-hardening batch from the June 23 security scan review.

### Security

- **`tropo view --out` output hardening** — rendered HTML writes must stay inside
  the tropo root, refuse symlink output paths, and replace the output path instead
  of truncating existing hard-linked files.
- **Heartbeat reports stay private** — scaffolded workspaces now gitignore
  `heartbeat-reports/*` (while keeping `.gitkeep`), the doctor flags missing report
  ignores, and strato's heartbeat procedure treats reports as PRIV because they may
  summarize private memory.
- **Doctor privacy ignore validation hardening** — `create-vivary doctor` now
  validates active `.gitignore` rules for `USER.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `memory/*`, and
  `heartbeat-reports/*` instead of accepting comments, negations, or unrelated
  substring matches as proof that private context files are ignored.
- **`exo claim` hard-link hardening** — claim writes now replace the workspace work
  item file instead of truncating an existing inode, so a hard-linked file outside
  the workspace is not mutated.
- **create-vivary symlink hardening** — scaffold writes, storage config writes, and
  stale generated cleanup now refuse symlinked destination parents and paths that
  resolve outside the selected workspace, including when `--force` is used.
- **create-vivary dry-run cleanup guard** — `--dry-run --force` previews the scaffold
  without removing stale generated files.
- **create-vivary embedded install fallback** — when `create-vivary` is run through
  `uvx`, embedded storage setup now falls back to `uv pip install --python ...` if
  the temporary Python environment does not include `pip`.

### Documentation

- **Security-hardening release truth** — README, FAQ, command docs, package READMEs,
  `SECURITY.md`, and the website now identify the package versions that carry the
  hardening batch.

### Changed

- `vivary-exo` now depends on `vivary-tropo>=0.2.3` so installed claim workflows use
  the hard-link-safe write behavior.
- `create-vivary` now depends on `vivary-tropo>=0.2.3`, and the npm launcher
  version `@vivary/create@0.2.5` pins the matching `create-vivary==0.2.5` PyPI
  scaffolder.
- `create-vivary init --no-wizard` now honors the documented lean default of file
  storage unless `--auto` or `--storage auto` is explicitly requested.

### Release note

Published through the manual human gate as `vivary-tropo==0.2.3`,
`vivary-exo==0.2.2`, `create-vivary==0.2.5`, and `@vivary/create@0.2.5`.
`create-vivary==0.2.4` was uploaded during release validation, then superseded by
0.2.5 after the public `uvx` smoke exposed the embedded-install fallback bug.
Verified from public PyPI/npm registries plus fresh `uvx` and `npm exec` scaffold
smokes.

## [vivary-tropo 0.2.2 / vivary-exo 0.2.1] — 2026-06-22

Affects `vivary-tropo` and `vivary-exo` only. `create-vivary` / `@vivary/create`
remain at 0.2.3, and `vivary-ozone` remains at 0.1.0.

### Fixed

- **UTF-8 BOM hardening** — tropo now treats a single leading UTF-8 BOM as a
  file-encoding artifact in both `tropo.toml` and Markdown frontmatter, so files
  produced by Windows PowerShell `Set-Content -Encoding UTF8` load normally.
- **`exo claim` no longer duplicates BOM-prefixed frontmatter** — claims update the
  existing frontmatter block, normalize the rewritten file to plain UTF-8, and still
  reject malformed frontmatter instead of guessing.

### Changed

- `vivary-exo` now depends on `vivary-tropo>=0.2.2` so installed claim workflows use
  the BOM-aware parser.

### Release note

Published through the manual human gate as `vivary-tropo==0.2.2` and
`vivary-exo==0.2.1`; no npm publish was needed. Verified from public PyPI pages plus
fresh `pip` and `uvx --no-cache --index-url https://pypi.org/simple` install smokes.

## [vivary-tropo 0.2.1 / vivary-exo 0.2.0] — 2026-06-22

Affects `vivary-tropo` and `vivary-exo` only. `create-vivary` / `@vivary/create`
remain at 0.2.3, and `vivary-ozone` remains at 0.1.0.

### Added

- **Graph-native work claiming** — `exo claim <id> --agent <handle>` writes a
  top-level `assignee` onto a work item under `changes/`, reports JSON with the
  previous assignee and whether the file changed, and leaves same-assignee claims as
  no-op success.
- **Opt-in coordination pack** — `packs = ["coordination"]` declares
  `assignee = "string"` as a base optional field, so exo can write claims without
  bloating every default workspace schema.
- **Embedded starter packs** — built-in tropo packs are embedded in the single-file
  engine so installed wheels can resolve `dev-project`, `repo-graph`, and
  `coordination` without relying on a repo-local `packs/` directory.
- **Pack parity tests** — tracked built-in pack TOML files are checked against the
  embedded values, and workspace-local `.tropo/packs/<name>.toml` files still take
  precedence over bundled packs.

### Changed

- `vivary-exo` now depends on `vivary-tropo>=0.2.1` so installed users get the
  bundled `coordination` pack required by `exo claim`.

### Release note

Released through the manual human gate as `vivary-tropo==0.2.1` and
`vivary-exo==0.2.0`; no npm publish was needed for this release.

## [0.2.3] — 2026-06-22

Affects `create-vivary` (PyPI) and `@vivary/create` (npm) only.

### Fixed

- **npm launcher pins the matching PyPI scaffolder** — `npm create @vivary@latest`
  now invokes `create-vivary@0.2.3` instead of leaving `uvx create-vivary` or
  `pipx run create-vivary` to resolve an unversioned package. This prevents stale
  tool caches from serving an older CLI without the `wizard` subcommand.
- **Launch copy uses the explicit latest npm form** — public install examples now
  prefer `npm create @vivary@latest my-workspace`, with direct Python usage shown as
  `uvx create-vivary@0.2.3 ...` or `pip install create-vivary==0.2.3`.

Use 0.2.3 for new installs. Existing PyPI 0.2.2 installs already include the wizard;
the hotfix is primarily for npm launcher provenance and fresh public onboarding.

## [0.2.2] — 2026-06-21

Affects `create-vivary` (PyPI) and `@vivary/create` (npm) only.

### Fixed

- **Supersedes 0.2.1** — use 0.2.2 for new installs. PyPI 0.2.1 was installable,
  but it was replaced by a clean CI-reviewed release after generated build artifacts
  were removed from the source tree. npm 0.2.1 was not live; 0.2.2 is the npm/PyPI
  lockstep release users should install.
- **Clean release provenance** — the repository source tree no longer includes the
  generated 0.2.1 wheel/sdist artifacts, and the release was re-cut after branch
  protection and CI-gated PR flow were restored.

No runtime API changes are expected for users already on 0.2.1; this is a source
and release-hygiene hotfix.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-06-21

Affects `create-vivary` (PyPI) only; no live `@vivary/create` npm 0.2.1 release was
published.

### Fixed

- **Wizard installs LanceDB inline** — when the interactive wizard's user picks "on this
  computer" (embedded storage), LanceDB now installs immediately as part of the wizard
  conversation. Previously, a second standalone "Install lancedb? [Y/n]" prompt appeared
  after the wizard ended, which was jarring and broke the mental model (the wizard IS the
  consent step).
- **`--auto` implies `--yes` for installs** — `create-vivary init . --auto --size large`
  no longer hangs on the install prompt. `--auto` means fully unattended; it now implies
  `yes=True` for every install step, so agents don't need to pass both `--auto` and `--yes`.
- **`wizard` subcommand** has the same two fixes applied.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-21

Affects `vivary-tropo` and `create-vivary`. `vivary-ozone` and `vivary-exo` are unchanged at 0.1.0.

### Added

- **Storage layer in tropo** — tiered storage abstraction: `file` (default, no new deps),
  `embedded` (LanceDB on disk, `pip install vivary-tropo[embedded]`), and `cloud` adapter
  interface (0.3.x). Config lives in `.vivary/storage.toml`. Optional extras:
  `vivary-tropo[embedded]`, `vivary-tropo[cloud]`, `vivary-tropo[astra]`.
- **`tropo migrate`** — move graph nodes between backends
  (`--from file --to embedded [--dry-run] [--json] [--yes]`).
- **`tropo query`** — text search over the workspace knowledge graph
  (`tropo query "auth module" [--k N] [--json]`).
- **Agent-mode flags on `create-vivary init`** — `--json`, `--dry-run`, `--auto`,
  `--yes`, `--no-wizard`, `--storage`, `--provider`, `--size`, `--privacy`.
  Agents can now self-configure a workspace end-to-end without human interaction.
- **`create-vivary wizard` subcommand** — reconfigure storage on an existing workspace.
- **Interactive setup wizard** — `create-vivary init` now prompts interactively when
  run from a TTY (human-friendly, no database jargon). `--no-wizard` or `--auto` skips it.
- **`.vivary/data/` in scaffolded `.gitignore`** — runtime storage data is always ignored.
- **`doctor` reports `backend` field** — JSON output now includes `"backend": "file|embedded|cloud"`.
- **Spec:** `docs/SPEC-data-layer.md` — full architecture rationale and agent CLI contract.

### Changed

- `create-vivary init` with `--storage embedded` self-installs `vivary-tropo[embedded]`
  (with confirmation unless `--yes`).
- `--dry-run` on `init` simulates the full scaffold without writing any files.

## [create-vivary 0.1.1] — 2026-06-14

Affects `create-vivary` (PyPI) and its npm launcher `@vivary/create`, released in
lockstep. The other three packages are unchanged at 0.1.0.

### Fixed

- A bare target now defaults to the `init` subcommand, so the documented
  `npm create @vivary@latest <name>` and `uvx create-vivary@0.2.3 <name>` scaffold a workspace
  without an explicit `init` (previously failed with argparse `invalid choice: …`).
  Explicit `init` / `doctor` and leading flags (`-h` / `--help`) pass through unchanged.
  npm launcher: [#33](https://github.com/vivary-dev/vivary/pull/33). Python CLI parity:
  [#35](https://github.com/vivary-dev/vivary/pull/35).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-14

Initial public release — all four layers on PyPI, the scaffolder also on npm.

### Added

- `vivary-tropo` — typed knowledge-graph CLI (`check` / `signal` / `types` / `stats` /
  `graph` / `blast` / `view` / `plan` / `fix` / `init`); `check` is strict by default.
- `vivary-ozone` — review layer (`review` / `impact` / `packs`).
- `vivary-exo` — coordination layer (`conflicts` / `board` / `roles`).
- `create-vivary` (PyPI) / `@vivary/create` (npm) — agent-workspace scaffolder
  (`init` / `doctor`; presets: `coding` · `second-brain` · `writing`).
