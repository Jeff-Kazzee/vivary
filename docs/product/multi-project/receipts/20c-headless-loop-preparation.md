# 20c deterministic headless-loop preparation receipt

Evidence-record: 20c
Date: 2026-09-07. Verification kind: runtime. Result: needs-info.

## Result and prerequisite

The offline coordinator implements the
[multi-agent phase decision](../design.md#multi-agent-phase-decision-2026-09-06).
Stages select adapters independently,
bind distinct assigned agents and native session references, and use declared
completion gates before handing accepted revisions to the next stage. One
persisted ledger covers every stage and retry. The workflow configuration owns
assignments; native integrations retain session creation and enforcement.

Independent source review closed the seven initial findings and one missing-ledger
follow-up. The author wave and reviewer-requested repeat each passed 18 control
tests in fresh offline Habitat containers. The reviewer independently checked
the repeat's source and execution evidence. These tests use doubles for the clock,
Git checkpoints, oracle observations, and native runtimes. They exercise routing,
gates, receipt artifacts, usage, and replay on real files. They do not execute
candidate subprocesses or prove the complete workflow lifecycle.

Packet 20c remains `needs-info`. The Habitat environment maintainer must supply a
wall clock proven nondecreasing across the complete container and subprocess
acceptance lifecycle. CPU affinity, keepalive activity, and elapsed time have not
met that prerequisite. The full strict suite was not repeated this session.
The strict deadline guard and owned-process/oracle implementation are byte-identical
to the preserved baseline. Runtime acceptance and independent full-suite acceptance
remain open. Packet 20a also retains its separate enforceable token-budget gate.

## Phase review and control evidence

The [packet](../packets/20c-headless-loop-preparation.md#declared-phase-checks-and-rework-routes)
defines the exact checks and bounded rework routes before implementation. The
coordinator persists a dispatch claim before invocation. Repeated claims refuse
without another reservation or successor call. Resume checks the workflow hash.
Accepted developer recovery binds the exact pre-transition state, ledger bytes,
candidate checkpoint, and report hashes. It preserves the original deadline.
An unbound or ambiguous interrupted stage requires reconciliation.

Review corrections distinguish valid incomplete responses from schema errors,
block no-progress exhaustion before creating a successor, include the accepted
developer report in QA, migrate CLI examples to `--workflow` and `--run-id`,
recover the accepted developer/state-write gap, and revalidate all accepted
reports during terminal replay. The author repaired the copied test root
permissions and missing test import. A missing recovery ledger now produces a
controlled refusal. The full-lifecycle recovery regression remains unrun.

| Wave | Result | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `control-a` | 8 of 12 passed; 4 errors | Copied fixture root was read-only; fixed. |
| `control-b` | 18 tests; 11 subcase errors | Missing test-helper import; fixed. |
| `control-c` | 18 passed in 2.707s | Precedes the missing-ledger review correction. |
| `control-d` | 18 passed in 2.389s, exit 0 | Final author control evidence. |
| `control-review-a` | 18 passed in 2.461s, exit 0 | Reviewer-requested repeat; source and evidence independently checked. |

Both final waves ran exactly:

```console
python3 -B -m unittest -v tools.tests.test_hoh_loop.StageBindingAndHandoffTests
```

The helper verified the recorded Habitat daemon and pinned image, then checked
the created container before starting it: unprivileged `ubuntu`, no network,
read-only root and source, dropped capabilities, no-new-privileges, two CPU quota
units on CPU 0, 1 GiB memory, and 128 processes. The helper permitted exactly two mounts:
read-only source and persistent writable `/tmp`, both resolved under the authorized
task root. There was no credential, Docker socket, or production checkout mount.
Both containers exited and remain retained. No model call or package install ran.

The delegated repeat launch stalled in the sandbox approval path and returned
only an aborted-call result after interruption. It produced no execution evidence.
The parent task launched the single retry through the same escalation boundary;
the independent reviewer then checked its source, configuration, and result.

## Source and evidence hashes

The final source manifest contains 13 files. Author and reviewer
manifests are byte-identical with SHA-256 `dd1b6f5d5a6fed6c441932e3a0fb13d0e3121fc826003f48996639a66cc791fa`.
The reviewed helper SHA-256 is `4f69c1a9ca4228b8f9134ba6a2fe69f09a8dbcc1bc30a90e86e6e00dd5bb7cc9`.
The independent review record SHA-256 is `8990cd961c403827e2fa32b8dbca0df0f2611adb66b7f29d2c7b54cebd2c2062`.

The private supplement has 64 entries, including source
archives, manifests, commands, transfer and test logs, container inspections,
review findings and closure, and the new resource inventory. Its manifest SHA-256
is `1d406fd8ac4cfab0093d34f2946b35ab5e7833af3a1bf38f5b38c39197310d4e`; archive SHA-256 is
`136d9521960e49a441b4760da30d432fcda91b451e23307b22ed42d3776c8fd9`. The export check restored every entry into a fresh private
directory and compared its path, size, and hash. Exact machine paths remain in the
existing private handoff. The supplement excludes persistent Habitat test-tree
contents; those remain in their retained task paths.

The 5 new stopped containers and 10 new
source/test directories are itemized in the supplement. The historical 41-container
and 74-path inventories below remain preserved; neither their resources nor this
session's resources were removed. Cleanup requires explicit itemized approval.

## Resume point and delivery

Document checks passed: the canonical plan renderer and check, tracked-file
line-ending checks, and diff whitespace validation. The site sync regenerated
its mirrors without deletion. The site build stopped because the checkout lacks
Astro: `'astro' is not recognized as an internal or external command`.
No dependency installation ran. A provisioned documentation-build environment
must complete that separate release check before publication.

Resume only 20c on `feat/headless-loop-preparation`. Preserve the local phase work
and owner documentation after `bc6445f`. The current packet, this receipt, and
the existing private HANDOFF.md own the continuation. Packet 24a stays complete;
this session claims no next ticket.

First obtain the Habitat maintainer's stable-clock evidence for the complete
lifecycle. Then verify the immutable integration commit
`794296f17116179700b27b536099994c78410802` remains an ancestor, match all
13 source hashes above, and review a fresh full-suite helper derived
from the retained strict boundary. Use the packet's full discovery command,
including the new lifecycle recovery regression. Run one author acceptance wave;
stop on any clock, isolation, source, or test failure. After a pass, a second
reader independently reruns the same full suite against those bytes.

Only then may 20c's runtime acceptance be marked passed. Keep PR #337 draft until
the required acceptance exists. Publication and merge retain the explicit gates
in AGENTS.md and the release workflow. No push, PR mutation, or merge occurred
this session. Package versions and published releases are unchanged.

## Historical evidence from 2026-09-06

The following evidence covers the earlier twelve-file contract. Its hashes and
failed clock observations remain preserved; it does not accept the phase work.

### Historical authority and environment


The current integration baseline is commit
`794296f17116179700b27b536099994c78410802`, tree
`33bd861cf331bbc64637b7243ee88355cb61cbd5`. Historical development waves preceded
that fast-forward. The twelve frozen source hashes remained unchanged across the
integration, and the later strict continuous wave used the current baseline.

The retained Habitat daemon reported ID
`3b437172-3fc6-4ee4-aa2b-f70e04c5a74a`, Docker root `/var/lib/docker`, and Docker
`29.7.2`. Every candidate wave used the existing image
`sha256:ffdba5d54dd6f91875fa60fc15103b6b30bb23ecaaf2d8ed65559d3cdff05bee`
with `--pull never`. The preflight reported UID and GID `1000`, Python `3.11.16`,
and Git `2.43.0`.

The final boundary used user `ubuntu`, `--network none`, a read-only root,
`--cap-drop ALL`, `--security-opt no-new-privileges`, two CPU quota units,
`--cpuset-cpus 0`, 1 GiB memory, and 128 processes. The source bundle was a
read-only mount. Only the persistent test root at `/tmp` was writable. The
container had no authentication volume, Docker socket, production checkout,
external network, or provider configuration.

No package installation, clock change, service change, model call, provider API
call, app server, schedule, paid service, commit, push, or cleanup ran.

## Frozen delivery bundle

The delivery manifest contains twelve entries. Its SHA-256 is
`452a434c0c37979747e9dff17ef7f0ca9df7ee13a5fc729a717aa602478f7061`.
The staged diff check found an extra blank line at EOF in three new files.
Delivery removes exactly one final LF byte from `linkcheck.py`, `spec.md`, and
`hoh/__init__.py`; the other nine files are byte-identical to the last tested
strict revision. This delivery revision has not been executed. It preserves
the strict clock policy, and runtime acceptance remains held.

The delivery source archive SHA-256 is
`d79e97433c059f29694d110fcd6d78ff5777dd48262ddd16c79de4752ebb8f15`.
All twelve archive members matched the delivery manifest by size and SHA-256.
The manifest, source archive, and byte-comparison record are retained as the
separate `delivery-whitespace-*` evidence supplement.

The historical strict test manifest is
`f5dce7382cd8c13049069954f1a50baafdc0781bce261db4d09115b0e16060fa`.
Three comparisons after the `dev` fast-forward found zero mismatches before
delivery whitespace normalization. Its preserved source archive SHA-256 is
`426e413510e8e0166a1f563def4de8c2eedb3ea97ae4cee3267ededf831d6ee7`.
The staging helper restored each archive into a fresh Habitat source root,
compared every file with the manifest, and made the source tree read-only before
container creation.

## Implemented controls and source review

The deterministic implementation covers the fixed four-case oracle, expected-red
starter, three role views, prompt assembly, strict records, token reservation and
settlement, iteration order, no-progress handling, resume, regression handling,
frozen QA input, and the native Claude CLI adapter preflight. The tests use only
deterministic role doubles and disposable fixture copies.

The final independent source review closed six findings:

1. A `developer_complete` resume requires exactly one matching developer receipt
   and binds its candidate, checkpoint, development document, and developer report.
2. Reopening `failed` or `regressed` state remains terminal when derived role views
   are absent.
3. An invalid developer response that changed its writable view cannot retry,
   export, or start the next role. A planner or unchanged read-only view retains
   the one schema retry.
4. Every receipt requires the baseline commit and tree Git object IDs. Resume
   validates every receipt against them.
5. A new baseline requires empty Git porcelain and an exact match between tracked
   files and actual non-Git files. Dirty, staged, untracked, and ignored additions
   all refuse.
6. The sequencer hashes each frozen candidate before and immediately after the
   product oracle. A self-mutating candidate writes an incomplete test receipt and
   stops before QA or acceptance.

The reviewer matched the strict hashes above and found no remaining defect in
these six areas. The reviewer made no independent runtime claim because the final
strict waves refused on the environment clock.

## Verification history

All candidate execution happened in retained offline Habitat containers. The
exact command was `python3 -B -m unittest discover -s tools/tests -p
'test_hoh*.py' -v`. Repository CI runs its existing guards but does not execute
this mutable-candidate suite. CI is not acceptance evidence for packet 20c.

| Wave | Boundary and result | Disposition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `green-hardening6` | 33 of 33 tests passed in 46.395 seconds on an earlier source revision | Useful pre-review evidence. Six later review fixes superseded its source bytes. |
| `green-final-review1` | Strict clock policy, normal affinity. 38 tests passed and one errored in 45.873 seconds. | Refused after the schema-retry fixture's four-test oracle passed but the wall clock moved backward. |
| `green-final-review2` | A temporary two-second clock tolerance produced 39 of 39 passing tests in 51.495 seconds. | Excluded. The tolerance conflicted with the packet rule, was reverted, and is absent from the frozen hashes. |
| `green-strict-affinity1` | Strict policy with CPU 0 affinity. 38 of 39 outer tests passed in 51.843 seconds. | Refused after an intentionally-red four-test oracle finished but the wall clock moved backward. |
| `green-strict-continuous1` | Strict policy with CPU 0 affinity and continuous distro activity. 38 of 39 outer tests passed in 47.932 seconds. | Refused after the no-progress fixture's four-test oracle passed but the wall clock moved backward. |

The outer failures do not show a mismatched fixture result. Each affected inner
oracle executed all four declared test IDs exactly once. The strict clock error
made its evidence incomplete before the later outer assertion.

## Clock evidence

| Observation | Wall result | Monotonic result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `green-final-review1` | Observed `1788732719446275221` after persisted `1788732720582900513`, a `-1,136,625,292` ns step. Process wall elapsed `-1,139,429,536` ns. | Process monotonic elapsed `625,752,967` ns. |
| `green-strict-affinity1` | Observed `1788733619921956926` after persisted `1788733621152017707`, a `-1,230,060,781` ns step. Process wall elapsed `-1,233,142,657` ns. | Process monotonic elapsed `748,368,178` ns. |
| `green-strict-continuous1` | Observed `1788734197332049984` after persisted `1788734198375883969`, a `-1,043,833,985` ns step. Process wall elapsed `-1,046,968,456` ns. | Process monotonic elapsed `676,831,993` ns. |

The first 20-second diagnostic sampled the original affinity and then pinned the
same process to CPU 0. The original phase recorded a `+2,004,441,775` ns wall
delta at sample 330 and a `-1,775,585,498` ns delta at sample 357. Both samples
began and ended on CPU 0. The phase had five CPU transitions elsewhere. Its
CPU-0 phase recorded no negative delta or one-millisecond clock divergence.
That single result did not prove affinity fixed the clock.

A second 20-second diagnostic during continuous distro activity recorded 1,827
normal-affinity samples and 1,778 CPU-0 samples with no negative delta or
one-millisecond divergence. The later candidate wave still observed the third
rollback above. Before and after that wave, `systemd-timesyncd` remained active
and running with `ActiveEnterTimestampMonotonic=4846921088` and
`ExecMainStartTimestampMonotonic=4846868642`. The keepalive did not satisfy the
prerequisite. The captured journal contained no new service start or sync event
during the wave, so the immediate cause of that last step remains unresolved.

## Excluded and refused attempts

The evidence archive preserves these attempts because none confers acceptance:

- A Windows host source parse and five host unit tests ran before the boundary
  correction. Their output and temporary paths are labeled excluded.
- A Docker Desktop probe reached the `desktop-linux` daemon. It did not contain
  the Habitat image or task containers. Every accepted daemon check used the
  explicit Habitat distro.
- An early helper invocation passed pipe characters through the WSL command
  boundary and refused before creating files or a container.
- The next transfer refused because ignored host bytecode appeared in the
  manifest but not the archive. Later bundles exclude bytecode from both.
- A reviewed diagnostic tried to bind a Windows `/mnt/c` path that the Habitat
  Docker host could not see. Docker refused before container creation. The next
  diagnostic received the same hashed script over standard input.
- `green-final-review2` changed the strict clock policy. Its result is retained
  for audit only. The final source and all resumable instructions use the strict
  rule.
- A journal capture command split its spaced `--since` argument and returned
  exit 1. A separate root read supplied the service history stated above.

## Evidence export and restoration

The final private evidence archive contains its manifest plus 195 evidence files,
including the frozen source archives and manifests, test logs, container
inspections, failure receipt extracts, clock diagnostics, excluded-attempt
records, retained-resource inventories, both earlier exports, and the private
host-time prerequisite note. Its manifest SHA-256 is
`74a0f7f00e1b8aa964402e60b1d2446fa3ec4a0ad13b0128d6b56c5dfcbc1d89`.
The archive SHA-256 is
`423b1468dd09bb0c667380f66a80a93b129607e182ed1e46f95fac132cf94390`.
The host-time note's SHA-256 is
`579670c0c89bf94762225cc6f7e0b9d7aef9625737c70fe1a19656f1c3346831`.

The owner extracted the final archive into a fresh ignored restore directory and
compared every listed byte count and SHA-256. All 195 evidence entries and the
restored manifest matched, with zero missing or changed files. The earlier 76-
and 48-entry archives and their zero-mismatch restores also remain preserved.

Private evidence remains under the authorized Littleagent evidence root and the
Habitat task root. This public receipt uses aliases for those machine-local
paths. It does not publish private filesystem coordinates.

## Historical resume instructions

The twelve-file resume recipe from 2026-09-06 is superseded by the current
resume point above. Its strict helper remains retained with SHA-256
`5727f1859a13947451d96f83ea53ff2f810f8f287d427b74c095668de6817d32`.
Do not run that old source revision as acceptance for the phase requirements.

## Retained cleanup disposition

No cleanup is approved or performed. Review these task-owned resources by
2026-09-13. The deterministic preparation owner must ask Jeff for explicit
approval before removing each container or path. The private inventories bind 41
stopped containers and 74 Habitat task-root paths. Their SHA-256 values are
`2970b3ea1013cdbcf906a9909a3e9dfa7bc68fdb3407ad5d4e18bcddaaed27d6`
and `6eb9294b10a215c0f11e76728b4803e13e92aa3c0eb898053bbee3a8da3936a4`.

### Private inventory records

The logical artifact `20c-retained-containers-final.txt` itemizes all 41
stopped task-owned containers. The logical artifact
`20c-retained-paths-final.json` itemizes all 74 retained Habitat task-root
directories with their file counts and byte totals. Both are included in the
final evidence export and bound by the hashes above. Exact machine-local names
remain in private evidence for the cleanup owner.

The archive preserves captured logs, source bundles, manifests, and the two
inventory records. It does not contain the persistent test-tree contents named
by the 74-path inventory. Those trees remain only in the private Habitat task
root pending itemized cleanup approval.

The delivery supplement, private evidence root, all three restored archive directories, all three
evidence archives, their manifests, and their restoration receipts also remain
retained. The bounded keepalive was a
temporary process with host PID `28620` and scheduled expiry `2026-09-06T22:48:05Z`.
No recurring job or cleanup schedule was created.
