# 20: Run bounded factory work
Type: outcome
Status: planned
Blocked-by: [04, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, 29]
Unlocks: [24, 36]

Execution: Start only a bounded packet listed in [the graph](../graph.md). Parent dependencies gate completion, not independent preparatory work.

## Goal

Run Littleagent S-08 and S-09 factory workflows with explicit authority, worker ownership, budgets, stop conditions, verification, and production gates.

## Context

Read [the native owner inventory](../native-owners.md) before adding any run, session, task, plan, messaging, scheduler, or resource infrastructure.

Program context: [design](../design.md), [migration](../migration.md), [release](../release.md), and [evidence](../evidence.md).

Own factory coordination, monitoring UI, receipts, and tests. Reuse verified runtime, task, plan, worker, and recovery services. Do not build a second scheduler or task queue.

## Done condition

Factory runs stop at configured boundaries and human gates. Every effect names its worker, project, task, plan, runtime, evidence, and measured cost. Restart and no-progress behavior converge.

Each durable iteration binds its input artifact, development document, native developer run, frozen candidate, independent QA report, and resulting artifact. Only the developer writes the artifact; the next planner consumes the prior verified behaviors and gaps. Reuse native dispatch and persistence. Keep iteration, budget, retry, and no-progress bounds explicit. Continue from file/receipt evidence when Brain is disabled; Brain promotion is a separate reviewed operation.

## Verify

Crash between candidate creation, QA, and replanning; recover the exact artifact/report pair without accepting an uncertain result or repeating an effect. Show a failed observation changes the next bounded task and a prior verified behavior remains a preservation constraint.

Run bounded multi-worker fixture scenarios for dependency order, no progress, budget refusal, cancellation, crash recovery, review rejection, and production gate.


Run the [canonical common planning checks](../execution-contract.md#maintaining-the-graph)
after changing this outcome's metadata. These checks validate planning documents;
they do not prove the behavior above.

## Log

- 2026-09-05: Initial public plan recorded. Implementation has not started.

- 2026-09-05: Refined acceptance after the owner-requested [HoH comparison](../research/hoh-alignment.md). These criteria remain unimplemented and unverified.

- 2026-09-06: Owner decision: loop first, code first, per [the direction decision](../design.md#direction-decision-2026-09-06). Packet [20a](../packets/20a-headless-loop-proof.md) proves one headless planning, coding, and testing iteration on files with a subscription CLI runtime before any GUI dependency. Acceptance adds all three ablation-backed mechanisms (plan revision from evidence, evidence feedback, artifact warm start), a regression and no-progress stop with a report, a code-quality decay check beside the pass check, and concurrency one measured before two. Unimplemented and unverified.

- 2026-09-06: The [PR #334 correction receipt](../receipts/pr-334-review-fixes.md) separates the runtime proofs into bounded packets. [20a](../packets/20a-headless-loop-proof.md) owns the first proof and must prepare its parity continuation before closing. Full factory and cross-runtime acceptance remain open.
- 2026-09-06: [20c](../packets/20c-headless-loop-preparation.md) keeps deterministic proof preparation claimable while 20a lacks its required native-call budget capability. Only 20a's live execution is blocked; preparation cannot establish runtime acceptance.
- 2026-09-06: Packet 20c froze the deterministic source and closed its six
  independent review findings. Its strict Habitat acceptance remains
  `needs-info` after repeated wall-clock reversals, so no live-runtime or
  factory behavior is accepted.
- 2026-09-06: The [multi-agent phase decision](../design.md#multi-agent-phase-decision-2026-09-06)
  requires distinct stage agents, per-stage runtime choice, and deterministic
  completion and handoff. Packet 20c owns the offline implementation gaps;
  mixed-stage native behavior requires separate evidence beyond parity runs.

- 2026-09-07: Packet 20c adds stage assignments, completion gates, durable handoffs,
  and shared usage/replay controls. Its independently reviewed source passed two
  18-test Habitat control waves. Full runtime acceptance awaits a stable clock.
